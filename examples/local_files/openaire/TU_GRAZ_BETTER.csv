In this study, we investigate the possibility of avoiding the individual training phase in the detection of movement intention in asynchronous BCIs based on movement-related cortical potential (MRCP). EEG signals were recorded during ballistic ankle dorsiflexions executed (ME) or imagined (MI) by 20 healthy subjects, and attempted by five stroke subjects. These recordings were used to identify a template (as average over all subjects) for the initial negative phase of the MRCPs, after the application of an optimized spatial filtering used for pre-processing. Using this template, the detection accuracy (mean???SD) calculated as true positive rate (estimated with leave-one-out procedure) for ME was 69???21 and 58???11?% on single trial basis for healthy and stroke subjects, respectively. This performance was similar to that obtained using an individual template for each subject, which led to accuracies of 71???6 and 55???12?% for healthy and stroke subjects, respectively. The detection accuracy for the MI data was 65???22?% with the average template and 60???13?% with the individual template. These results indicate the possibility of detecting movement intention without an individual training phase and without a significant loss in performance.","247935","Open Access","-0.0771","0.4662","9","Stroke rehabilitation","Stroke rehabilitation","36",NA,NA,"",""

The European Commission (EC) has recently renewed their efforts to establish such a coordination effort by funding a coordination and support action for the BCI community called ‘BNCI Horizon 2020’ after the ‘Future BNCI’ project. Major goals of this new project include developing a roadmap for the next decade and beyond, encouraging discussion and collaboration within the BCI community, fostering communication with the general public, and the foundation of an international BCI Society. We present a short overview of current and past EU-funded BCI projects and provide evidence of a growing research and industrial community. Efficient communication also entails the establishment of clear terminology, which is a major goal of BNCI Horizon 2020. To this end, we give a brief overview of current BCI-related terms and definitions. A major networking activity in the project was the BNCI Horizon 2020 Retreat in Hallstatt, Austria. Over 60 experts participated in this event to discuss the future of the BCI field in a series of plenary talks, targeted discussions, and parallel focus sessions. A follow-up event was the EU BCI Day at the 6th International Brain-Computer Interface Conference in Graz, Austria. This networking event included plenary talks by eight companies and representatives from all seven ongoing EU research projects, poster presentations, demos, and discussions. Another goal of BNCI Horizon 2020 is the foundation of an official BCI Society. In this article, we summarize the current status of this process. Finally, we present visions for future BCI applications developed within BNCI Horizon 2020 using input from external BCI experts as well. We identify common themes and conclude with six exemplary use cases.","224051","Open Access","-0.4709","0.6043","15","Bci, Bnci horizon","Bci, Bnci horizon","42","14","142","",""

			electroencephalographic signals to drive prostheses that support upper limb movement. Only few BCIs used hemodynamic signals or were designed to control lower extremity prostheses. Recent technological developments indicate that functional 
			near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-BCI can be exploited in rehabilitation of lower limb movement due to its great usability and reduced sensitivity to head motion artifacts. 

			Objective: The aim of this proof of concept study was to assess whether hemodynamic signals underlying lower limb motor preparation in stroke patients can be reliably measured and classified. 

			Methods: fNIRS data were acquired during preparation of left and right hip movement in 7 chronic stroke patients. 

			Results: Single-trial analysis indicated that specific hemodynamic changes associated with left and right hip movement preparation can  be  measured  with  fNIRS.

			Method: A group of healthy subjects walked on a treadmill with and without robotic aiding at speeds of 1.5, 2.0
			and 2.5 Km/h. The guidance force was varied between 20%, 40%, 70% and 100% level of assistance. EMG

			Results: Four motor modules were sufficient to represent the variety of behavioral goals demanded during robotic

			confirming that the low-dimensional and impulsive control of human walking is maintained using robotic force
			guidance. The conditions of guidance force and speed that maintained correct and incorrect (not natural) modular

			Conclusion: In neurologically intact subjects robotic-guided walking at various force guidance and speed levels
			does not alter the basic locomotor control and timing. This allows the design of robotic-aided rehabilitation

In particular, the study explored the use of Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA), a multivariate data analysis in order to assess and clarify the process of regaining independence after stroke. Methods: A randomized double-blind controlled trial was performed. Thirteen subjects with residual hemiparesis after a single stroke episode were measured in both in- and outpatient settings at a district hospital. All subjects were able to walk before suffering the stroke and were hemodynamically stable within the first week after stroke. Control and target groups were treated with conventional physiotherapy for stroke, but specific techniques were added for treatment of the target group depending on patients' functional levels. Independence level was assessed with the Barthel Index (BI) throughout 7 evolution stages (hemodynamic stability, beginning of standing, beginning of physical therapy sessions in the physiotherapy ward and monthly assessment for 6 months after stroke). Results: FPCA was applied for data analysis. Statistically significant differences were found in the dynamics of the recovery process between the two physiotherapy protocols. The target group showed a trend of improvement six months after stroke that was not present in the control group. Conclusions: FPCA is a method which may be used to provide greater insight into the analysis of the rehabilitation process than that provided by conventional parametric methods. So, by using the whole curves as basic data parameters, subtle differences in the rehabilitation process can be found. FPCA represents a future aid for the fine analysis of similar physiotherapy techniques, when applied in subjects with a huge variability of functional recovery, as in the case of post-stroke patients.

It also examines the possible benefits of including assistive robotic devices and brain-computer interfaces in this field, according to a top-down approach, in which rehabilitation is driven by neural plasticity. The methods reviewed comprise classical gait rehabilitation techniques (neurophysiological and motor learning approaches), functional electrical stimulation (FES), robotic devices, and brain-computer interfaces (BCI). From the analysis of these approaches, we can draw the following conclusions. Regarding classical rehabilitation techniques, there is insufficient evidence to state that a particular approach is more effective in promoting gait recovery than other. Combination of different rehabilitation strategies seems to be more effective than over-ground gait training alone. Robotic devices need further research to show their suitability for walking training and their effects on over-ground gait. The use of FES combined with different walking retraining strategies has shown to result in improvements in hemiplegic gait. Reports on non-invasive BCIs for stroke recovery are limited to the rehabilitation of upper limbs; however, some works suggest that there might be a common mechanism which influences upper and lower limb recovery simultaneously, independently of the limb chosen for the rehabilitation therapy. Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) enables researchers to detect signals from specific regions of the cortex during performance of motor activities for the development of future BCIs. Future research would make possible to analyze the impact of rehabilitation on brain plasticity, in order to adapt treatment resources to meet the needs of each patient and to optimize the recovery process.

Methods Ten users with CP participated in the study. Whereas the control group (n?=?5) followed traditional therapies, the experimental group (n?=?5) complemented these therapies with a series of ten sessions of gaming with ENLAZA to exercise cervical flexion?extensions, rotations and inclinations in a controlled, engaging environment. Results The ten work sessions yielded improvements in head and trunk control that were higher in the experimental group for Visual Analogue Scale, Goal Attainment Scaling and Trunk Control Measurement Scale (TCMS). Significant differences (27% vs. 2% of percentage improvement) were found between the experimental and control groups for TCMS (p?<?0.05). The kinematic assessment shows that there were some improvements in the active and the passive range of motion. However, no significant differences were found pre- and post-intervention.

Towards this goal, we used left versus right hand movement execution and movement imagery as study paradigms in a series of experiments. In the first two experiments, activations in the motor cortex during movement execution and movement imagery were used to develop subject-dependent models that obtained high classification accuracies thereby indicating the robustness of our classification method. In the third experiment, a generalized classifier-model was developed from the first two experimental data, which was then applied for subject-independent neurofeedback training. Application of this method in new participants showed mean classification accuracy of 63% for movement imagery tasks and 80% for movement execution tasks. These results, and their corresponding offline analysis reported in this study demonstrate that SVM based real-time subject-independent classification of fNIRS signals is feasible.

Recently it has been reported that two MI tasks can be separated with a high accuracy within the first second after cue presentation onset. To investigate this phenomenon in detail we studied the dynamics of motor cortex beta oscillations in EEG and the changes in heart rate (HR) during visual cue-paced foot MI using a go (execution of imagery) vs. nogo (withholding of imagery) paradigm in 16 healthy subjects. Both execution and withholding of MI resulted in a brisk centrally localized beta event-related desynchronization (ERD) with a maximum at ~400 ms and a concomitant HR deceleration. We found that response patterns within the first second after stimulation differed between conditions. The ERD was significantly larger in go as compared to nogo. In contrast the HR deceleration was somewhat smaller and followed by an acceleration in go as compared to nogo. These findings suggest that the early beta ERD reflects visually induced preparatory activity in motor cortex networks. Both the early beta ERD and the HR deceleration are the result of automatic operating processes that are likely part of the orienting reflex (OR). Of interest, however, is that the preparatory cortical activity is strengthened and the HR modulated already within the first second after stimulation during the execution of MI. The subtraction of the HR time course of the nogo from the go condition revealed a slight HR acceleration in the first seconds most likely due to the increased mental effort associated with the imagery process.","247935","Open Access","0.4463","-0.1612","1","Neuroscience","Neuroscience","12","2","42","",""

In this study we examined the impact of an interactive Virtual Environment (VE) feedback task on the EEG patterns during robot assisted walking. We compared walking in the VE modality to two control conditions: walking with a visual attention paradigm, in which visual stimuli were unrelated to the motor task; and walking with mirror feedback, in which participants observed their own movements. Eleven healthy participants were considered. Application of independent component analysis to the EEG revealed three independent component clusters in premotor and parietal areas showing increased activity during walking with the adaptive VE training paradigm compared to the control conditions. During the interactive VE walking task spectral power in frequency ranges 8-12, 15-20, and 23-40 Hz was significantly (p ? 0.05) decreased. This power decrease is interpreted as a correlate of an active cortical area. Furthermore activity in the premotor cortex revealed gait cycle related modulations significantly different (p ? 0.05) from baseline in the frequency range 23-40 Hz during walking. These modulations were significantly (p ? 0.05) reduced depending on gait cycle phases in the interactive VE walking task compared to the control conditions. We demonstrate that premotor and parietal areas show increased activity during walking with the adaptive VE training paradigm, when compared to walking with mirror- and movement unrelated feedback. Previous research has related a premotor-parietal network to motor planning and motor intention. We argue that movement related interactive feedback enhances motor planning and motor intention. We hypothesize that this might improve gait recovery during rehabilitation.","247935","Open Access","0.0895","-0.3324","5","Alley activates premotor, Robot aided walking, Coordination of locomotion","Alley activates premotor, Robot aided walking, Coordination of locomotion","39",NA,"97","",""
