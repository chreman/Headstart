Solutions of the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, [C2mim]Cl, which contain both Cu+ and Cu2+ ions, show current oscillations during potentiostatic polarization. The oscillations were analyzed by the Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) technique and by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The electrochemical oscillations are of the N-NDR-type, because the low frequency end of the impedance spectrum has negative real impedances. The oscillating current leads to an oscillating growth speed of a metallic copper layer. Besides the presence of both Cu+ and Cu2+, the presence of chloride is a necessary, yet not a sufficient, condition for the occurrence of current oscillations. Oscillating currents were also observed for the ionic liquids 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride and 1-butyl-2,3-dimethyl-imidazolium chloride, but not for tributyltetradecyl-phosphonium chloride and N-butylpyridinium chloride.","216474","Open Access","-0.5792","0.2438","4","Electrochemistry","Electrochemistry",5,NA,NA,"",""

Complete removal of water demands heating above 150 1C under reduced pressure, as proven by Nuclear Reaction Analysis (NRA). Dissolved oxygen gas can only be removed by the use of an oxygen scavenger such as hydroquinone, despite the fact that calculations show that oxygen should be removed completely by the applied vacuum conditions. After applying a strict drying procedure and scavenging of molecular oxygen, it was possible to deposit copper directly on tantalum without the presence of an intervening oxide layer.","216474","Open Access","-0.4675","-0.37","7","Copper","Copper",9,"2","15","",""

This type of ionic liquid, with a high concentration of copper(I) ions permits to achieve high nucleation densities. Furthermore, extremely high overpotentials (up to 5.0 V) can be applied without decomposition of the ionic liquid. The deposition of copper has been investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The resulting copper deposits can be useful as seed layers for aqueous copper filling.","216474","Open Access","-0.1298","-0.0619","1","Cationic cuprous organic, Complexes ionic","Cationic cuprous organic, Complexes ionic",8,NA,NA,"",""
