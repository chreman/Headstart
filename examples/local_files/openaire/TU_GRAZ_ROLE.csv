Workplace and lifelong learning, however, implicate that learners are more self-motivated, capable, and self-confident in achieving their goals and, consequently, tempt to consider that certain development tasks can be shifted to end-users in order to facilitate a more flexible, open, and responsive learning environment. With respect to streams like end-user development and opportunistic design, this paper elaborates a methodology for user-driven environment design for action-based activities. Based on a former research approach named 'Mash-Up Personal Learning Environments'(MUPPLE) we demonstrate how workplace and lifelong learners can be empowered to develop their own environment for collaborating in learner networks and which prerequisites and support facilities are necessary for this methodology.","231396","Open Access","0.4351","0.0344","3","Personal learning environments, Informal learning, Regulated learning","Personal learning environments, Informal learning, Regulated learning",NA,NA,NA,"",""

In this paper, we first describe the creation of new ROLE widgets and widget bundles at Galileo University, Guatemala, within a cloud-based infrastructure. We introduce an initial architecture for cloud interoperability services including the means for collecting interaction data as needed for learning analytics. Furthermore, we describe the newly implemented widgets, namely a social networking tool, a mind-mapping tool and an online document editor, as well as the modification of existing widgets. The newly created and modified widgets have been combined in two different bundles that have been evaluated in two web-based courses at Galileo University, with participants from three different Latin-American countries.

To accomplish this, ROLE´s main objective is to support the development of open personal learning environments (PLE's). ROLE provides a framework consisting of “enabler spaces” on the one hand and tools, content, and services on the other. Utilizing this framework, learners are invited to create their own controlled and preferred learning environments to trigger and motivate self-regulated learning.\ud \ud Authors of this book are researchers, developers and teachers who have worked in the ROLE project and belong to the ROLE partner consortium consisting of 16 internationally renowned research institutions, including those from 6 EU countries and China.

The advent of the social Web 2.0 and open-source software is seen to be the main enabling factor for self-directed, collaborative and informal learning practices. Roadmaps and vision documents serve an important role in shaping the immediate or more distant future of TEL. Various stakeholders have published such documents in the past two years. Research in TEL is carried out in order to reach the envisaged goals; vice versa the goals change due to progress in research. TEL is not just a research area: e-learning takes place at universities, companies and other institutions, as well as at home. These practices are evolving due to the availability and take-up of platforms and tools. In this first STELLAR trend report we survey the more distant future of TEL, as reflected in the roadmaps; we compare the visions with trends in TEL research and TEL practice.

Components of PLEs are selected and configured by individual users based on their personal preferences, needs, and goals. Moreover, the systems usually evolve over time based on contextual opportunities and constraints. As such dynamic systems have no predefined configurations and user interfaces, traditional evaluation methods often fall short or are even inappropriate. Obviously, a host of factors influence the extent to which a PLE successfully supports a learner to achieve specific learning outcomes. We categorize such factors along four major dimensions: technological, organizational, psycho-pedagogical, and social. Each dimension is informed by relevant theoretical models (e.g., Information System Success Model, Community of Practice, self-regulated learning) and subsumes a set of metrics that can be assessed with a range of approaches. Among others, usability and user experience play an indispensable role in acceptance and diffusion of the innovative technologies exemplified by PLEs. Traditional quantitative and qualitative methods such as questionnaire and interview should be deployed alongside emergent ones such as learning analytics (e.g., context-aware metadata) and narrative-based methods. Crucial for maximal validity of the evaluation is the triangulation of empirical findings with multi-perspective (end-users, developers, and researchers), mixed-method (qualitative, quantitative) data sources. The framework utilizes a cyclic process to integrate findings across cases with a cross-case analysis in order to gain deeper insights into the intriguing questions of how and why PLEs work.","231396","Open Access","-0.0359","0.1277","3","Personal learning environments, Informal learning, Regulated learning","Personal learning environments, Informal learning, Regulated learning","0",NA,NA,"",""

This paper presents the implemented prototype of the ROLE interoperability framework and a business and an educational case study. The framework provides a common technical infrastructure to assemble widgets and services in Personal Learning Environments (PLEs). Evaluation results indicate that the perceived usefulness and usability is high for one case study in which a mature LMS was enriched with ROLE technology. In the second case study, an early mash-up prototype was deployed. The usefulness and usability of this early prototype were rated low, but the case study provides interesting insights for further research and development.","231396","Open Access","-0.0411","-0.0087","3","Personal learning environments, Informal learning, Regulated learning","Personal learning environments, Informal learning, Regulated learning","9","1","2","",""

			This paper presents an approach of collecting contextualized attention metadata combined from inside as well as outside a LMS and analyzing them to create feedback about the student activities for the teaching staff. Two types of analyses were run on the collected data: first, key actions were extracted to identify usage patterns and tendencies throughout the whole course and then usage statistics and patterns were identified for some key actions in more detail. Results of both analyses were visualized and presented to the teaching staff for evaluation.
			The research leading to these results has received funding
			from the European Community’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-
			2013) under grant agreement no 231396 (ROLE project). Work was also partially

			The generation of Contextualized Attention Metadata (CAM) allows to  retrieve information about the different actions that users execute over  different resources in a specific context. This paper presents how CAM  is used within a learning system to personalize help provided to  students while working on online exercises. We outline our approach and  present two application examples within this framework for the  personalization of exercises with hints.

This process has been often discussed theoretically, but never empirically evaluated. Several question related to basic characteristics of the publication process are raised at the beginning of the paper and answered through quantitative analysis. To provide a wide view of the publication process, this paper analyzes four types of repositories: Learning Object Repositories, Learning Object Referatories, Open Courseware Initiatives, and Learning Management Systems. For comparison, Institutional Repositories are also analyzed. Three repository characteristics are measured: size, growth, and contributor base. The main findings are that the amount of learning objects is distributed among repositories according to a power law, the repositories mostly grow linearly, and the amount of learning objects published by each contributor follows heavy-tailed distributions. The paper finally discusses the implications that this findings could have in the design and operation of Learning Object Repositories.","231396","Open Access","0.6166","-0.1836","5","Ariadne infrastructure, Automatic assembly, Automatic evaluation","Ariadne infrastructure, Automatic assembly, Automatic evaluation","51",NA,NA,"",""

The mashups are usually realized either through a seamless integration, in which only the resulting application is known by the end-users, or through integration of original applications, data sources, and tools, particularly in terms of widgets, into the same graphical space, in which participating applications and data sources are identifiable by the end-users. The former composes a unified functionality or data presentation/source from the original sources. The latter generates a digital environment in which participating sources exist as individual entities, but the true integration can only be realized through enabling widgets to be responsive to the events happening in each other. We call such an integration widget orchestration. In this paper, we provide a holistic view on the mashup era and a theoretical grounding for widget-based digital environments, we elaborate on key challenges for realizing such environments and (semi-)automatic widget orchestration, and we introduce our solution strategies. We identified following challenges: widget interoperability, user-behavior mining, and infrastructure. We introduce functional interfaces (FWI) for application interoperability, exploit semantic web technologies for data interoperability, and investigate the possibility of employing workflow/process mining techniques, along with Petri nets as a formal ground, for user-behavior mining. We outline a reference platform and architecture, compliant with our strategies, to foster re-usability of widgets and development of standardized widget-based environments. We have implemented a prototype for a Widget-based Personal Learning Environment (WIPLE) for foreign language learning in order to demonstrate the feasibility of our solution strategies, framework, and architecture.","231396","Open Access","-0.3392","-0.0765","4","Personal learning environments, Cloud services interoperability, Enabled personal learning","Personal learning environments, Cloud services interoperability, Enabled personal learning","4",NA,NA,"",""

In this paper, we investigate the measures of scholars’ influence in academic social media platforms, taking both academic and social impact into account. A real-life dataset collected from Mendeley is used to apply different influence metrics. We first assess the academic influence of scholars based on the scientific impact of their publications using three different measures. Then we investigate their social influence using network centrality metrics. The experiments show that top influencers with high academic impact tend to be senior scholars with many coauthors. Furthermore, academic influence and social influence measures do not strongly correlate with each other, and thus scholars with high academic impact are not necessarily influential from a social point of view. Adding the social dimension could enhance the traditional impact metrics that only take academic influence into account.","231396","Open Access","-0.6816","0.3495","1","Agile aggregation, Digital ecosystems, Social software","Agile aggregation, Digital ecosystems, Social software","12",NA,NA,"",""

First, the pervasiveness of web-based knowledge-sharing in higher education&#x0027;s communities, observatories and social networks makes it easier to: introduce relevant technologies, find people doing similar things, learn from their experiences, find and collaborate with early adopters of learning technologies, hear about relevant innovations, and discover and exploit news of opportunities, threats and trends. Second, expeditionary change based on such knowledge-sharing facilitates transformations in: production functions for learning, roles of faculty and mentors, business models, patterns and cadences of interactivity, use of open resources, and the roles of learners. Third, those transformations make it easier for disruptive forms of higher education to emerge; for example, dynamically updated curricula that address emerging and important knowledge gaps, and thereby increase students&#x0027; employability.","231396","Open Access","-0.1931","-0.2282","3","Personal learning environments, Informal learning, Regulated learning","Personal learning environments, Informal learning, Regulated learning","0",NA,NA,"",""

Several new evaluation techniques have been developed and established in the last years. One of them is ‘learning curves’, which aim at measuring error rates of users when they interact with adaptive educational systems, thereby enabling the underlying models to be evaluated and improved. In this paper, we report how we have applied this new method to two case studies to show that learning curves are useful to evaluate didactical models and their implementation in educational platforms. Results show that the error rates follow a power law distribution with each additional attempt if the didactical model of an instructional unit is valid. Furthermore, the initial error rate, the slope of the curve and the goodness of fit of the curve are valid indicators for the difficulty level of a course and the quality of its didactical model. As a conclusion, the idea of applying learning curves for evaluating didactical model on the basis of usage data is considered to be valuable for supporting teachers and learning content providers in improving their online courses.","231396","Open Access","-0.2606","0.1731","3","Personal learning environments, Informal learning, Regulated learning","Personal learning environments, Informal learning, Regulated learning","0",NA,NA,"",""
