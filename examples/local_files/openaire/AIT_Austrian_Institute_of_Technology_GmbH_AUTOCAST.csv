In particolare, dopo aver descritto la posizione assunta dalla Commissione sul documento di bilancio nazionale, descrive le criticitÃ evidenziate dall’organismo comunitario in merito all’attuazione delle riforme strutturali e le opportunitÃ offerte agli Stati membri dalla Comunicazione in merito alla flessibilitÃ del Patto di stabilitÃ e crescita, adottata il 13 gennaio scorso.","201525","Open Access","-0.451","-0.4679","4","","",NA,NA,NA,"",""

However, in the case of interturn short circuit in stator, the traditional symmetrical component method has lost the precondition due to the harmonics and noise; the negative sequence component (NSC) is hard to be obtained accurately. For broken rotor bars, the new added fault feature blanked by fundamental component is also difficult to be discriminated in the current spectrum. To solve the above problems, a fundamental component extraction (FCE) method is proposed in this paper. On one hand, via the antisynchronous speed coordinate (ASC) transformation, NSC of extracted signals is transformed into the DC value. The amplitude of synthetic vector of NSC is used to evaluate the severity of stator fault. On the other hand, the extracted fundamental component can be filtered out to make the rotor fault feature emerge from the stator current spectrum. Experiment results indicate that this method is feasible and effective in both interturn short circuit and broken rotor bars fault diagnosis. Furthermore, only stator currents and voltage frequency are needed to be recorded, and this method is easy to implement.","201525","Open Access","0.1351","0.5716","3","","",0,NA,NA,"",""

While it is reaping more and more express market, the managers are facing difficult decisions to design the service network. This paper investigates the HPTB-EPS network design problem and analyses the time-space characteristics of such network. A mixed-integer programming model is formulated integrating the service decision, frequency, and network flow distribution. To solve the model, a decomposition-based heuristic algorithm is designed by decomposing the problem as three steps: construction of service network, service path selection, and distribution of network flow. Numerical experiment using real data from our partner company demonstrates the effectiveness of our model and algorithm. We found that our solution could reduce the total cost by up to 16.3% compared to the carrier’s solution. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates the robustness and flexibility of the solutions of the model.","201525","Open Access","-0.5413","0.2998","1","","",0,NA,NA,"",""
