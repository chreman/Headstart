Infrastructural Power and the Rise of Market-Based (Central) Banking","Braun, B.","2016-01-01","Foundation for European Progressive Studies","publication","","","","To explain when and how finance wins, political economists have studied the financial sector’s instrumental power to lobby policymakers and the structural power that results from its central position in the economy. Focusing on the rise and resilience of market-based banking in the euro area, this paper develops the concept of infrastructural power as a third, complementary variant. Theoretically, the argument is based on the observation that state actors, in addition to acting on markets, also act in markets. Central banking is the clearest manifestation of such market-based state agency. To the extent that the central bank depends on financial markets to implement and transmit its monetary policy, financial market actors enjoy infrastructural power. The paper analyses the origins and manifestations of this infrastructural power by tracing the alliances the European Central Bank has formed with the two key pillars of market-based banking, the repo and the securitisation markets. This infrastructural entanglement between market-based banking and market-based central banking has been both an enabling condition and a key driver for the Capital Markets Union project.","120209","Open Access","-0.583","0.3144","1","Banking, Central, Market based","Banking, Central, Market based",NA,NA,NA,"",""

Little is known about how achievement of financially incentivised and non-incentivised indicators of quality of care varies with deprivation, or about the effect of financial incentives on health inequalities in hypertension. General practices in the UK have received financial incentives for high quality care since 2004. This study set out to assess the variations in achievement of incentivised and non-incentivised quality indicators for hypertension by patient area deprivation, before and after the introduction of financial incentives.</p> <p>Methods</p> <p>Achievement of 14 quality indicators for hypertension in 304 patient participants in 18 general practices in Norfolk, England was assessed one year before (2003) and one year after (2005) the introduction of financial incentives. Four indicators were incentivised and 10 were non-incentivised. Each participant's postcode was linked to an index of multiple deprivation score.</p> <p>Results</p> <p>The range of achievement of incentivised quality indicators was 65-94% in the least deprived third of participants, and 77-94% in the most deprived third in 2003 and 2005 combined.

In our study, we aimed at exploring the neural correlates of dimensional autistic traits using a dual approach of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and graph theoretical analysis of resting state functional MRI data. Subjects were sampled from a public neuroimaging dataset of healthy volunteers. Inclusion criteria were adult age (age: 18-65), availability of DTI and resting state functional acquisitions and psychological evaluation including the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and Autistic Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ). The final subject cohort consisted of 127 neurotypicals. Global brain network structure was described by graph theoretical parameters: global and average local efficiency. Regional topology was characterized by degree and efficiency. We provided measurements for diffusion anisotropy. The association between autistic traits and the neuroimaging findings was studied using a general linear model analysis, controlling for the effects of age, gender and IQ profile. Significant negative correlation was found between the degree and efficiency of the right posterior cingulate cortex and autistic traits, measured by the combination of ASSQ and SRS scores. Autistic phenotype was associated with the decrease of whole-brain local efficiency. Reduction of diffusion anisotropy was found bilaterally in the temporal fusiform and parahippocampal gyri. Numerous models describe the autistic brain connectome to be dominated by reduced long-range connections and excessive short-range fibers. Our finding of decreased efficiency supports this hypothesis although the only prominent effect was seen in the posterior limbic lobe, which is known to act as a connector hub. The neural correlates of the autistic trait in neurotypicals showed only limited similarities to the reported findings in clinical populations with low functioning autism.","120209","Open Access","0.5411","0.3701","9","Social and behavioral sciences","Social and behavioral sciences",16,"5","72","",""

Single-particle energies and densities as well as S-matrix pole trajectories are studied in a few SFR potentials suited for the description of neutrons interacting with light and heavy nuclei. The SFR potentials considered are the standard cut-off Woods--Saxon (CWS) potentials and two potentials approaching zero smoothly: the SV potential introduced by Salamon and Vertse and the SS potential of Sahu and Sahu. The parameters of these latter were set so that the potentials may be similar to the CWS shape. The range of the SV and SS potentials scales with the cube root of the mass number of the core like the nuclear radius itself. For light nuclei a single term of the SV potential (with a single parameter) is enough for a good description of the neutron-nucleus interaction. The trajectories are compared with a bench-mark for which the starting points (belonging to potential depth zero) can be determined independently. Even the CWS potential is found to conform to this bench-mark if the range is identified with the cutoff radius. For the CWS potentials some trajectories show irregular shapes, while for the SV and SS potentials all trajectories behave regularly.","120209","Open Access","0.0196","-0.6516","2","Nuclear theory","Nuclear theory",0,NA,NA,"",""

The antiviral drugs that are currently available limit the ability of the virus to multiply in infected individuals, but they rarely eliminate the virus entirely. A better understanding of how HIV behaves in the cell would help researchers to find a cure for persistent HIV infection. When HIV enters an immune cell, its genetic material ? in the form of molecules of ribonucleic acid (RNA) ? is used as a template to make molecules of DNA. This viral DNA can integrate into the host cell?s DNA, where it is used as a template to make more viral RNA molecules, which are then used to make viral proteins. Some of the viral RNAs are also packaged into new virus particles. In cells, RNA molecules are often subject to a chemical modification called adenosine methylation, which regulates how that RNA is translated into proteins. Specific enzymes add molecules called methyl tags to particular locations on the RNA, while other enzymes remove them. A family of proteins called YTHDF1?3 recognize and bind to these methyl tags on the RNA and influence how much protein is produced from the target RNA. There is evidence to suggest that the cell can add methyl tags to HIV RNA. However, the extent to which this happens, and what effects this modification has on HIV replication and viral protein production, are not clear. Tirumuru et al. addressed these questions by analyzing how changing the levels of YTHDF1?3 proteins and the enzymes that add or remove methyl tags in human cells affected HIV infection. The experiments show that YTHDF1?3 proteins inhibited HIV infection in immune cells called T-lymphocytes by recognizing HIV RNA that had been methylated, mainly by targeting the step where the viral RNA is copied into DNA. Altering the levels of the enzymes that add or remove methyl tags in the cells can change the amount of methyl tags attached to RNA molecules, which alters the amount of HIV protein produced. For example, when more RNA molecules had methyl tags, the cells produced more HIV proteins. These findings suggest that adenosine methylation plays an important role in regulating the ability of HIV to thrive and multiply in T-lymphocytes, which are an important target for HIV. Since the RNAs of other human viruses, such as influenza virus, can also be modified by adenosine methylation, drugs that target this pathway could have the potential to be used to fight a variety of viral illnesses.
