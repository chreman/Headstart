Due to their exceptional properties, a wide field of applications is opened for carbon nanotubes. Regarding this field, knowing their toxicity becomes a key issue.The work presented here aims towards the synthesis of chemical derivatives designed to increase interactions between carbon nanotubes and a biological environment. The synthesis of a series of cholesterol derivatives aimed for the functionalization of carbon nanotubes has been developed. Such derivatives are intended to interact with cell membranes.Moreover, many synthetic intermediates have mesomorphic properties. These properties have been studied using different methods such as polarized optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray scattering (MWAXS).HiPco nanotubes have been purified, functionalized and characterized with techniques such as Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD).Finally, a study of carbon nanotubes toxicity is presented.; Du fait de leurs exceptionnelles propriétés, un très vaste champ d'applications s'ouvre aux nanotubes de carbone.

However, the use of heavy-metal-containing nanoparticles remains an issue of debate. The possible toxic effects of quantum dots remain a hot research topic and several questions such as possible intracellular degradation of quantum dots and the effect thereof on both cell viability and particle functionality remain unresolved. In the present work, poly(methacrylic acid)-coated CdSe/ZnS quantum dots were synthesized and characterized, after which their effects on cultured cells were evaluated using a multiparametric setup. The data reveal that the quantum dots are taken up through endocytosis and when exposed to the low pH of the endosomal structures, they partially degrade and release cadmium ions, which lowers their fluorescence intensity and augments particle toxicity. Using the multiparametric method, the quantum dots were evaluated at non-toxic doses in terms of their ability to visualize labeled cells for longer time periods. The data revealed that comparing different particles in terms of their applied dose is challenging, likely due to difficulties in obtaining accurate nanoparticle concentrations, but evaluating particle toxicity in terms of their biological functionality enables an easy and straightforward comparison.

Direct instillation of long and short CNTs into the pleural cavity, the site of mesothelioma development, produced asbestos-like length-dependent responses. The response to long CNTs and long asbestos was characterized by acute inflammation, leading to progressive fibrosis on the parietal pleura, where stomata of strictly defined size limit the egress of long, but not short, fibers. This was confirmed by demonstrating clearance of short, but not long, CNT and nickel nanowires and by visualizing the migration of short CNTs from the pleural space by single-photon emission computed tomographic imaging. Our data confirm the hypothesis that, although a proportion of all deposited particles passes through the pleura, the pathogenicity of long CNTs and other fibers arises as a result of length-dependent retention at the stomata on the parietal pleura.","246479","Open Access","-0.4566","-0.6043","2","Acute pleural, Adenocarcinoma cells, Asbestos induced","Acute pleural, Adenocarcinoma cells, Asbestos induced","150","1","75","",""

The purpose of this work is to review recent studies in one largely unexplored area of nanobiotechnology: the development of nano-bio hybrid materials that exploit Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to enhance the functionalities of technologically promising photosynthetic biomaterials. One of very promising approaches is to employ semiconductor quantum dots having a broad absorption spectrum as nanoantennae coupled with the natural light-harvesting complexes of photosynthetic reaction centers. This system reveals great potential for the utilization of quantum dots in artificial photosynthetic devices. The second very useful functionality, which is discussed in this review, is the possibility to enhance the efficiency of the main biological function (proton pumping) of the protein bacteriorhodopsin using nonradiative energy transfer from quantum dots. Also recent studies revealed that FRET-based improvement of the biological function of bacteriorhodopsin in the presence of quantum dots allows for strong wavelength-dependent enhancement of the nonlinear refractive index of bacteriorhodopsin. These new hybrid bio-nanomaterials with exceptional light-harvesting and nonlinear properties will have numerous photonic applications employing their photochromic, energy transfer, and energy conversion properties. © 2014.","246479","Closed Access","-0.4264","0.1465","3","Semiconductor quantum dots, Energy transfer, Dots and bacteriorhodopsin","Semiconductor quantum dots, Energy transfer, Dots and bacteriorhodopsin","13",NA,NA,"",""

			Communication at the nanoscale can enhance capabilities for nanodevices, and at the same time open new opportunities for numerous healthcare applications. One approach towards enabling communication between nanodevices is through molecular communications. While a number of solutions have been proposed for molecular communication (e.g. calcium signaling, molecular motors, bacteria communication), in this paper we propose the use of neuronal networks for molecular communication network. In particular we provide two design aspects of neuron networks, which includes, (i) the design of interface between nanodevice and neurons that can initiate signaling, and (ii) the design of transmission scheduling to ensure that signals initiated by multiple devices will successfully reach the receiver with minimum interference. The solution for (i) is developed through wet lab experiments, while the solution for (ii) is developed through genetic algorithm optimization technique, and is validated through simulations.

			Abstract: Studying protein interactions is of vital importance both to fundamental biology research and to medical applications. Here, we report on the experimental proof of a universally applicable label-free homogeneous platform for rapid protein analysis. It is based on optically detecting changes in the rotational dynamics of magnetically agitated core-shell nanorods upon their specific interaction with proteins. By adjusting the excitation frequency, we are able to optimize the measurement signal for each analyte protein size. In addition, due to the locking of the optical signal to the magnetic excitation frequency, background signals are suppressed, thus allowing exclusive studies of processes at the nanoprobe surface only. We study target proteins (soluble domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 - sHER2) specifically binding to antibodies (trastuzumab) immobilized on the surface of our nanoprobes and demonstrate direct deduction of their respective sizes. Additionally, we examine the dependence of our measurement signal on the concentration of the analyte protein, and deduce a minimally detectable sHER2 concentration of 440 pM. For our homogeneous measurement platform, good dispersion stability of the applied nanoprobes under physiological conditions is of vital importance. To that end, we support our measurement data by theoretical modeling of the total particle-particle interaction energies. The successful implementation of our platform offers scope for applications in biomarker-based diagnostics as well as for answering basic biology questions.","335078","Open Access","-0.0077","0.3134","8","Direct protein, Nanorod probes","Direct protein, Nanorod probes","6","1","13","",""

Cobalt NRs with a mean diameter of 15 nm were first synthesized by the polyol process and then heated at 300 °C in octadecene (ODE), oleylamine (OA) or mixtures of these two solvents. The surface and structural modifications of the Co NRs were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). A disordered carbon shell was formed at the cobalt rod surface, the thickness of which can be tuned from 5 to 25 nm by increasing the amount of oleylamine in the solvent mixture. This carbon shell partially reduced the native cobalt oxide observed at the surface of the NRs and drastically improved their temperature stability as inferred from in-situ XRD study and TEM. The shape anisotropy and the crystallite anisotropy of the hcp phase are both preserved up to 400 °C for the carbon coated cobalt rods whereas the uncoated NRs lose their anisotropy at 225 °C. Treatments at 300 °C in ODE/OA mixtures for different durations allowed the progressive carburization of Co to Co2C. The crystallographic orientation of the Co2C grains within the cobalt NRs combined with the different carbon shell thickness on the {10-10} and (0001) facets of the rods suggested a preferential carburization from the lateral facets of the hcp cobalt rods.","280670","Open Access","0.3761","-0.677","2","Acute pleural, Adenocarcinoma cells, Asbestos induced","Acute pleural, Adenocarcinoma cells, Asbestos induced","17",NA,NA,"",""

Here, we present a detailed theoretical analysis of the hysteresis losses in dipolar-coupled magnetic nanoparticle assemblies as a function of both the geometry and length of the array, and of the orientation of the particles' magnetic anisotropy. Our results suggest that the chain-like arrangement biomimicking magnetotactic bacteria has the superior heating performance, increasing more than 5 times in comparison with the randomly distributed system when aligned with the magnetic field. The size of the chains and the anisotropy of the particles can be correlated with the applied magnetic field in order to have optimum conditions for heat dissipation. Our experimental calorimetrical measurements performed in aqueous and agar gel suspensions of 44 nm magnetite nanoparticles at different densities, and oriented in a magnetic field, unambiguously demonstrate the important role of chain alignment on the heating efficiency. In low agar viscosity, similar to those of common biological media, the initial orientation of the chains plays a minor role in the enhanced heating capacity while at high agar viscosity, chains aligned along the applied magnetic field show the maximum heating.

However, their exploitation is undermined by their sensitivity toward oxygen and water, which deteriorates their magnetic properties. The development of a continuous metal shell inert to oxidation could render them stable, opening perspectives not only for already identified applications but also for uses in which contact with air and/or aqueous media is inevitable. However, the direct growth of a conformal noble metal shell on magnetic metals is a challenge. Here, we show that prior treatment of Co nanorods with a tin coordination compound is the crucial step that enables the subsequent growth of a continuous noble metal shell on their surface, rendering them air- and water-resistant, while conserving the monocrystallity, metallicity and the magnetic properties of the Co core. Thus, the as-synthesized coreshell ferromagnetic nanorods combine high magnetization and strong uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, even after exposure to air and water, and hold promise for successful implementation in in vitro biodiagnostics requiring probes of high magnetization and anisotropic shape.","312483","Open Access","0.2902","0.5932","10","Equipment and supplies, Crystalline polymer, Hybrids structural","Equipment and supplies, Crystalline polymer, Hybrids structural","9",NA,NA,"",""

Although nanoparticles continue to enter cells, the targeting specificity of transferrin is lost.

			as early-stage indicator of inflammatory responses of macrophages (THP-1) and of subtle phenotypic
			damages of lung epithelial (A549) cells following exposure to chemically-treated SWCNTs. Our results
			showed that, while most of the cellular responses of A549 cells exposed to SWCNTs are different to those of
			similarly treated THP-1 cells, the protein citrullination process is triggered in a dose- and time-dependent
			manner in both cell lines, with thresholds comparable between inflammatory (THP-1) and
			non-inflammatory (A549) cell types. The cellular mechanism proposed herein could have a high impact in

Use of nanobody (99m)Tc-D10 of a size as small as 15.5 kDa enables detection of tumours by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging already 45 min post intravenous administration with high tumour uptake (>3% ID/g) in small MDA-MB-468 and A431 tumours, with tumour volumes of 52.5 mm(3) ± 21.2 and 26.6 mm(3) ± 16.7, respectively. Fast blood clearance with a serum half-life of 4.9 min resulted in high in vivo contrast and ex vivo tumour to blood and tissue ratios. In contrast, no accumulation of (99m)Tc-D10 in MDA-MB-231 tumours characterized by a very low expression of EGFR was observed. Here we present specific and high contrast in vivo visualization of small human tumours overexpressing EGFR by preclinical multi-pinhole SPECT shortly after administration of anti-EGFR nanobody (99m)Tc-D10.

The immune complexes were visualized by fluorescently labeled streptavidin and simultaneously analyzed using a flow cytometer. Preclinical validation of the immunoassay was performed and results were compared with those obtained using an alternative 3-plex immunoassay based on Luminex xMAP? technology, developed on classical organic fluorophores. The comparison showed that the QDEM and xMAP? assays yielded almost identical results, with clear discrimination between control and clinical samples. Thus, developed QDEM technology can become a good alternative to xMAP? assays permitting analysis of multiple protein biomarkers using conventional flow cytometers.","246479","Open Access","-0.3172","-0.3419","7","Cell imaging probes, Quantum dot based, Antibody quantum","Cell imaging probes, Quantum dot based, Antibody quantum","3",NA,NA,"",""

			Platelet aggregation is essential for vascular haemostasis and thrombosis. To improve the therapy of arterial thrombotic disorders and identify novel therapeutic targets it is imperative to study basic mechanisms of platelet thrombus formation. To date most data on biology, physiology and pharmacology of platelet aggregation have been obtained by studying this phenomenon under static or quasi-dynamic conditions at the macroscale level. There is a widespread recognition for the need of new technologies that will help to further elucidate the role of platelets in physiological and pathological thrombus formation and to design more effective and specific antithrombotic drugs. Micro- and nanofluidic devices, capable of reaching nanoscale resolution, can be used for this purpose setting the scene for the development of novel methods for studying platelet function in physiology, pathology and therapeutics.","246479","Open Access","-0.0734","0.7365","2","Acute pleural, Adenocarcinoma cells, Asbestos induced","Acute pleural, Adenocarcinoma cells, Asbestos induced","13",NA,NA,"",""

			The work presented here describes the preparation of new fluorescent, magnetic polystyrene (PS) nanowires via vacuum assisted infiltration of porous anodised aluminium oxide (AAO) membranes. A polymer solution of high molecular weight PS in THF, superparamagnetic magnetite nanoparticles and coumarin-153 dye is used to create the nanowires (NW) within the 200 nm diameter membranes. NW released by membrane dissolution have a high aspect ratio and a curled 'bamboo' like structure to them. NW have been characterised by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). These wires were strongly luminescent and show good response to an external magnetic field. VSM measurements of these samples have shown presence of both superparamagnetic (SPM) and non-superparamagnetic components. The biological application potential of NW was also investigated by functionalising them with primary and secondary antibodies and incubation with epithelial lung cancer cells (A549 cell line). NW showed binding affinity to the surface of the cells and also endocytotic internalisation in the case of short wires. These structures have good potential for use in bio-medical imaging and diagnostic applications due to their additional modalities linked to their intrinsic material properties.

High resolution transmission electron microscopy and Mössbauer spectroscopy investigations revealed that the particles are spheres primarily composed of Fe3O4 with a small fraction of FeO. From Mössbauer and static magnetization measurements, it was deduced that the particles are superparamagnetic at room temperature. The hydrophobic particles were successfully transferred into water via PEGylation using nitrodopamine as an anchoring group. IR spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis showed the success and efficiency of the phase transfer reaction. After PEGylation, the particles retained monodispersity and their magnetic core remained intact as proven by photon cross-correlation spectroscopy, ac susceptibility, and transmission electron microscopy. The particle aqueous suspensions revealed excellent water stability over a month of monitoring and also against temperature up to 40 °C. The particles exhibited a moderate cytotoxic effect on in vitro cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages and no release of inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines. The PEGylated particles were functionalized with Herceptin antibodies via a conjugation chemistry, their response to a rotating magnetic field was studied using a fluxgate-based setup and was compared with the one recorded for hydrophobic and PEGylated particles.

			Yoke-shaped sensors based on MgO-barrier magnetic tunnel junctions have been designed, fabricated, and studied; they show a good linear tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) response. A nearly-perpendicular configuration of two ferromagnetic electrodes was set by two-step annealing together with shape anisotropy. The low-frequency noise characterization shows these yoke-shaped TMR sensors have relatively low magnetic 1/f noise. The field sensitivity is up to 27%/mT, while the field detectivity reaches 4.6 nT/Hz‾‾‾√ at 10 Hz and 460 pT/Hz‾‾‾√ at 1 kHz. These TMR sensors may be useful for applications such as biomagnetic detection.

			Highly ordered nanoporous anodic aluminium oxide templates with uniform or periodically modulated pore diameters have been fabricated by the hard-pulse anodization technique. Straight and diameter-modulated CoFe nanowires with diameters of 60 nm and 60/120 nm, respectively, were AC-pulse electrodeposited into the templates. A comparison of magnetisation curves of the two types of nanowires show a typical coercivity (μ0 H c) of 74 mT and squareness (SQ) of 92% for the modulated wires, which are significantly squarer but have 12% lower coercivity compared to the 60 nm straight CoFe wires (μ0 H c = 84 mT, SQ = 60%). The difference is attributed to magnetostatic interactions between the segments due to the stray field of the modulated wires. Diameter modulation is an attractive way of producing soft magnetic nanowires with a controllable hysteresis loop shape. The time required for the nanoporous template fabrication by hard-pulse anodization is typically one tenth of that needed for conventional template fabrication methods, hence making it suitable for large-scale nanowire production.

As selection steps are performed in vitro, it is possible to focus the outcome of the selection on relevant epitopes by performing some additional steps, such as depletion or competitive elutions. However in practice, the efficiency of these steps is often limited and can lead to inconsistent results. We have designed a new selection method named masked selection, based on the blockade of unwanted epitopes to favor the targeting of relevant ones. We demonstrate the efficiency and flexibility of this method by selecting single-domain antibodies against a specific portion of a fusion protein, by selecting binders against several members of the seven transmembrane receptor family using transfected HEK cells, or by selecting binders against unknown breast cancer markers not expressed on normal samples. The relevance of this approach for antibody-based therapies was further validated by the identification of four of these markers, Epithelial cell adhesion molecule, Transferrin receptor 1, Metastasis cell adhesion molecule, and Sushi containing domain 2, using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. This new phage display strategy can be applied to any type of antibody fragments or alternative scaffolds, and is especially suited for the rapid discovery and identification of cell surface markers.","246479","Open Access","0.2372","-0.6486","7","Cell imaging probes, Quantum dot based, Antibody quantum","Cell imaging probes, Quantum dot based, Antibody quantum","12","1","51","",""

			Background:  Nanomaterials such as SiO2 nanoparticles (SiO2NP) are finding increasing 
			applications in the biomedical and biotechnological fields such as disease diagnostics, imaging, 
			drug delivery, food, cosmetics and biosensors development. Thus, a mechanistic and systematic 
			evaluation of the potential biological and toxic effects of SiO2NP becomes crucial in order to assess 
			their complete safe applicability limits. 
			Results:  In this study, human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 and human alveolar epithelial 
			cell line A549 were exposed to a range of amorphous SiO2NP of various sizes and concentrations 
			(0.01, 0.1 and 0.5 mg/ml). Key biological indicators of cellular functions including cell population 
			density, cellular morphology, membrane permeability, lysosomal mass/pH and activation of 
			transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) were evaluated utilizing quantitative high content screening (HCS) 
			approach and biochemical techniques. Despite the use of extremely high  nanoparticle 
			concentrations, our findings showed a low degree of cytotoxicity within  the panel of SiO2NP 
			investigated. However, at these concentrations, we observed the onset of stress-related cellular 
			response induced by SiO2NP.  Interestingly, cells exposed to alumina-coated SiO2NP showed low 
			level, and in some cases complete absence, of stress response and this was consistent up to the 
			highest dose of 0.5 mg/ml. 
			Conclusions:  The present study demonstrates and highlights the importance of subtle biological 
			changes downstream of primary membrane and endocytosis-associated phenomena resulting from  
			high dose SiO2NP exposure.   Increased activation of transcription factors, such as ATF-2, was 
			quantitatively assessed as a function of i) human cell line specific stress-response, ii) SiO2NP size 
			and iii) concentration. Despite the low level of cytotoxicity detected  for the amorphous SiO2NP 
			investigated, these findings prompt an in-depth focus for future SiO2NP-cell/tissue investigations 
			based on the combined analysis of more subtle signalling pathways associated with accumulation 
			mechanisms, which is essential for establishing the bio-safety of existing and new nanomaterials.

			Background

			Different superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles have been tested for their potential use in cancer treatment, as they enter into cells with high effectiveness, do not induce cytotoxicity, and are retained for relatively long periods of time inside the cells. We have analyzed the interaction, internalization and biocompatibility of dimercaptosuccinic acid-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with an average diameter of 15 nm and negative surface charge in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.
			Results

			Cells were incubated with dimercaptosuccinic acid-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for different time intervals, ranging from 0.5 to 72 h. These nanoparticles showed efficient internalization and relatively slow clearance. Time-dependent uptake studies demonstrated the maximum accumulation of dimercaptosuccinic acid-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles after 24 h of incubation, and afterwards they were slowly removed from cells. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles were internalized by energy dependent endocytosis and localized in endosomes. Transmission electron microscopy studies showed macropinocytosis uptake and clathrin-mediated internalization depending on the nanoparticles aggregate size. MCF-7 cells accumulated these nanoparticles without any significant effect on cell morphology, cytoskeleton organization, cell cycle distribution, reactive oxygen species generation and cell viability, showing a similar behavior to untreated control cells.
			Conclusions

			All these findings indicate that dimercaptosuccinic acid-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles have excellent properties in terms of efficiency and biocompatibility for application to target breast cancer cells.

This thesis reports on the use of hamonic nanoparticles (HNPs) as non-linear labels for multiphoton microscopy. HNPs are inorganic non-centrosymmetric nanoparticles (NPs) generating a second harmonic signal at any femtosecond excitation wavelength within their transparency range. They display a photostable signal and exert an excellent optical contrast with respect to a standard fluorescent cell dye under normal imaging conditions. The optical properties and biocompatibility of six different HNPs are evaluated to identify the best candidate for biological applications.Then HNPs are used for the first time as exogenous optical contrast agents for the study of the differentiation of embryonic stem cells in vitro. Finally, we propose an original approach to cancer theranostics based on the nonlinear optical properties of HNPs. Le projet européen FP7 NAMDIATREAM a pour objectif le développement de nouveaux outils de détection précoce du cancer du sein, du poumon et de la prostate basés sur les nanotechnologies. Cette thèse décrit l’utilisation de nanoparticules harmoniques (HNPs) en tant que marqueurs pour la microscopie à excitation multiphotonique. Les HNPs sont des nanoparticules inorganiques noncentrosymétriques qui génèrent un signal de seconde harmonique à n’importe quelle longueur d’onde d’excitation comprise dans leur plage de transparence. Elles émettent un signal photostable et exercent un excellent contraste optique par rapport à un marqueur cellulaire fluorescent sous des conditions d’imagerie normales. Les propriétés optiques et la bio-compatibilité de six différentes nanoparticules harmoniques seront évaluées pour identifier le meilleur candidat pour les applications biologiques. Puis les HNPs sont utilisées pour la première fois comme agent de contraste exogène pour l’étude de la différentiation in vitro de cellules souches embryonnaires.

Here, we report the design of a Fab-like bispecific antibody (HER2bsFab) that displays a moderate affinity for HER2 and a unique, specific and high affinity for FcγRIII. In vitro characterization showed that ADCC was the major mechanism of action of HER2bsFab as no significant HER2-driven effect was observed. HER2bsFab mediated ADCC at picomolar concentration against HER2high, HER2low as well as trastuzumab-refractive cell lines. In vivo HER2bsFab potently inhibited HER2high tumor growth by recruitment of mouse FcγRIII and IV-positive resident effector cells and more importantly, exhibited a net superiority over trastuzumab at inhibiting HER2low tumor growth. Moreover, FcγRIIIA-engagement by HER2bsFab was independent of V/F158 polymorphism and induced a stronger NK cells activation in response to target cell recognition. Thus, taking advantage of its epitope specificity and affinity for HER2 and FcγRIIIA, HER2bsFab exhibits potent anti-tumor activity against HER2low tumors while evading most of trastuzumab Fc-linked limitations thereby potentially enlarging the number of patients eligible for breast cancer immunotherapy.","246479","Open Access","0.2074","-0.6953","7","Cell imaging probes, Quantum dot based, Antibody quantum","Cell imaging probes, Quantum dot based, Antibody quantum","10","1","16","",""

By virtue of their intravascular topography, endothelial cells are exposed to dynamically changing mechanical forces that are generated by blood flow. In the present study, we investigated the interactions of negatively charged 2.7 nm and 4.7 nm CdTe quantum dots and 50 nm silica particles with cultured endothelial cells under regulated shear stress (SS) conditions. Cultured cells within the engineered microfluidic channels were exposed to nanoparticles under static condition or under low, medium, and high SS rates (0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 Pa, respectively). Vascular inflammation and associated endothelial damage were simulated by treatment with tumor necrosis factor-&amp;alpha; (TNF-&amp;alpha;) or by compromising the cell membrane with the use of low Triton X-100 concentration. Our results demonstrate that SS is critical for nanoparticle uptake by endothelial cells. Maximal uptake was registered at the SS rate of 0.05 Pa. By contrast, endothelial exposure to mild detergents or TNF-&amp;alpha; treatment had no significant effect on nanoparticle uptake. Atomic force microscopy demonstrated the increased formation of actin-based cytoskeletal structures, including stress fibers and membrane ruffles, which have been associated with nanoparticle endocytosis. In conclusion, the combinatorial effects of SS rates, vascular endothelial conditions, and nanoparticle physical and chemical properties must be taken into account for the successful design of nanoparticle&amp;ndash;drug conjugates intended for parenteral delivery.Keywords: endothelium, shear stress, quantum dots, membrane ruffling, stress fibers, atomic force microscopy, microfluidics","246479","Open Access","0.1128","-0.2608","14","Antibody bio, Biocompatible multifunctional, Bio conjugation","Antibody bio, Biocompatible multifunctional, Bio conjugation","5",NA,NA,"",""

In order to evaluate the reaction of human colon cells to USPIO NPs, the effects of non-stabilized USPIO NPs (NS-USPIO NPs), oleic-acid-stabilized USPIO NPs (OA-USPIO NPs), and free oleic acid (OA) were compared in human HT29&amp;nbsp;and CaCo2&amp;nbsp;colon epithelial cancer cells. First the biophysical characteristics of NS-USPIO NPs and OA-USPIO NPs in water, in cell culture medium supplemented with fetal calf serum, and in cell culture medium preconditioned by HT29&amp;nbsp;and CaCo2&amp;nbsp;cells were determined. Then, stress responses of the cells were evaluated following exposure to NS-USPIO NPs, OA-USPIO NPs, and free OA. No modification of the cytoskeletal actin network was observed. Cell response to stress, including markers of apoptosis and DNA repair, oxidative stress and degradative/autophagic stress, induction of heat shock protein, or lipid metabolism was determined in cells exposed to the two NPs. Induction of an autophagic response was observed in the two cell lines for both NPs but not free OA, while the other stress responses were cell- and NP-specific. The formation of lipid vacuoles/droplets was demonstrated in HT29&amp;nbsp;and CaCo2&amp;nbsp;cells exposed to OA-USPIO NPs but not to NS-USPIO NPs, and to a much lower level in cells exposed to equimolar concentrations of free OA. Therefore, the induction of lipid vacuoles in colon cells exposed to OA utilized as a stabilizer for USPIO NPs is higly amplified compared to free OA, and is not observed in the absence of this lipid in NS-USPIO NPs.Keywords: oleic acid, ultrasmall iron oxide nanoparticles, human colon cells, lipid vacuoles, stress reaction, heat shock proteins","310584","Open Access","0.3722","-0.5391","7","Cell imaging probes, Quantum dot based, Antibody quantum","Cell imaging probes, Quantum dot based, Antibody quantum","0",NA,NA,"",""

Quantum dots (QD) nanoparticles have been used for diagnostics, and recent work suggests their use for in vivo molecular and cellular imaging. However, the hemocompatibility of QDs and their constituent components has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, comprehensive investigation of QD&amp;ndash;platelet interactions is presented. These interactions were shown using transmission electron microscopy. The effects of QDs on platelet function were investigated using light aggregometry, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, flow cytometry, and gelatin zymography. Platelet morphology was also analyzed by phase-contrast, immunofluorescence, atomic-force and transmission electron microscopy. We show that the QDs bind to platelet plasma membrane with the resultant upregulation of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa and P-selectin receptors, and release of matrix metalloproteinase-2. These findings unravel for the first time the mechanism of functional response of platelets to ultrasmall QDs in vitro.

In that regard, homogeneous measurement principles are especially relevant as they usually do not require extensive sample preparation procedures, thus reducing the total analysis time and maximizing ease-of-use. In this review, we focus on homogeneous biosensors for the in vitro detection of biomarkers. Within this broad range of biosensors, we concentrate on methods that apply magnetic particle labels. The advantage of such methods lies in the added possibility to manipulate the particle labels by applied magnetic fields, which can be exploited, for example, to decrease incubation times or to enhance the signal-to-noise-ratio of the measurement signal by applying frequency-selective detection. In our review, we discriminate the corresponding methods based on the nature of the acquired measurement signal, which can either be based on magnetic or optical detection. The underlying measurement principles of the different techniques are discussed, and biosensing examples for all techniques are reported, thereby demonstrating the broad applicability of homogeneous in vitro biosensing based on magnetic particle label actuation.","246479","Open Access","0.0137","0.5081","8","Direct protein, Nanorod probes","Direct protein, Nanorod probes","17","3","30","",""

The last decades have seen a development of new imaging techniques now in widespread clinical use. The development of nano-imaging through fluorescent imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to detect and diagnose cancer at an earlier stage than with current imaging methods. The characteristic properties of nanoparticles result in their theranostic potential allowing for simultaneous detection of and treatment of the disease. This review provides state of the art of the nanotechnological applications for cancer therapy.
