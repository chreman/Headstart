Compared to 'normal' deliverables, 'living' deliverables come into existence much earlier than their delivery deadline and are expected to 'live on' after their official delivery to the European Commission. They are expected to foster collaboration. Within this contribution we investigate, how these deliverables have been used over the first 16 months of the project. We therefore propose a set of new analysis methods facilitating social network analysis on publicly available revision history data. With this instrumentarium, we critically look at whether the living deliverables have been successfully used for collaboration and whether their 'afterlife' beyond the contractual deadline had turned them into 'zombies' (still visible, but no or little live editing activities). The results show that the observed deliverables show signs of life, but often in connection with a topical change and in conjunction with changes in the pattern of collaboration.","","-0.0422","-0.7348","6","Collaboration, Living deliverables","Collaboration, Living deliverables","",""

Automated reflection detection provides a solution to this problem. Within this paper, a new basic architecture for detecting evidence of reflection is proposed that allows for automated marking up of written accounts of certain, observable elements of reflection. Furthermore, three promising example annotators of elements of reflection are identified, implemented, and demonstrated: detecting reflective keywords, premise and conclusions of arguments, and questions. It appears that automated detection of reflections bears the potential to support learning with technology at least on three levels: it can foster creating awareness of the reflectivity of own writings, it can help in becoming aware of reflective writings of others, and it can make visible reflective writings of learning networks as a whole.","","0.2973","-0.6062","11","Automated, Detection, Reflection","Automated, Detection, Reflection","",""

Usage experiences were available predominantly for the \"mature\" part of the infrastructure provided by standard Web 2.0 tools adapted to STELLAR needs. Evaluations are provided for newly developed tools. We first provide an overview of the whole STELLAR Science 2.0 Infrastructure and the relationships between the building blocks. While the individual building blocks already benefit researchers, the integration between them is the key for a positive usage experience. The publication meta data ecosystem for example provides researchers with an easy to retrieve set of TEL related data. Tools like the ScienceTable, Muse, the STELLAR latest publication widget, and the STELLAR BuRST search show already several scenarios of how to make use of this infrastructure. Especially a strong focus on anlytical tools based on publication and social media data seem useful. In order to highlight the relevance of the infrastructure to the individual capacitiy building activties within STELLAR, the usage experiences of individual building blocks are then reported with respect to Researcher Capacity (e.g. Deliverable Wikis, More! application), Doctoral Academy Capacity (e.g. DoCoP), Community Level Capacity (e.g TELeurope), and Leadership Capacity (e.g. Meeting of Minds, Podcast Series). Here we draw from 11 scientific papers published. The reader will find an overview of all these papers in the Appendix. Based on the usage experiences and evaluations we have identified a number of ideas which might be worth considering for future developments. For example, the experiences gained with the Deliverable Wikis show how the modification of the standard Wiki history can provide useful analytical insights into the collaboration of living deliverables and can return the focus on authorship (which is intentionally masked in Wikis, because of their strong notion on the product and not on authors). We conclude with main findings and an outlook on the development plan and evaluation plan which are currently being developed and which will influence D6.6. Particularly, we close with the notion of a Personal Research Environment (PRE) which draws from the concept of Personal Learning Environments (PLE).","","-0.1875","-0.5171","7","[shs.edu] humanities and social sciences/education","[shs.edu] humanities and social sciences/education","",""

However, this variety can make it difficult for researchers and teachers to assess the tool that is best suited to their objectives and contexts as learning designers. Several of the tools are presented elsewhere in this issue. In this article, the aforementioned tools are used as lenses to view the same learning design narrative – an inquiry-based learning lesson on healthy eating aimed at secondary-school students – from different perspectives, in a manner inspired by the plot structure of Kurosawa’s film “Rashomon”. In modelling the lesson on five tools, we uncovered similarities and differences in relation to the challenges posed by modelling a particular learning scenario, the ease of implementation of the computer-interpretable products’ output by the tools and their different target audiences and pedagogical specialities. This comparative analysis thus illustrates some of the current underlying issues and challenges in the field of Learning Design.Keywords: learning design; authoring tools; inquiry learning; personal inquiry(Published: 16 September 2013)Citation: Research in Learning Technology Supplement 2013, 21: 20057 - http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/rlt.v21i0.20057","10.3402/rlt.v21i0.20057","0.2313","0.2942","3","Learning design rashomon, Supporting the design","Learning design rashomon, Supporting the design","",""

So as to support this aim, the network has defined a number of different activity tracks, aimed at building capacity amongst senior-level researchers/decision makers, mid-level researchers and junior researchers/PhD students as well with a separate track dedicated to building community level capacity. In the abstract, the community around any research study might usually be defined as the subject of the research. However, the focus of the community-capacity building activities of STELLAR, considers the role of the community as object of the research  a main consumer of the products of research, and having a stake in setting the research agenda itself. Thus, on the one hand, the STELLAR consortium needs to inform its actions and activities based on needs and wishes of stakeholders, while at the same time it intends to mobilise the same stakeholders, to forge common policy positions with respect to future development of TEL in Europe. This paper takes these activities as a case-study in structured social-network design, and considers the impact such activities may have on the field of technology enhanced learning in the coming years. The data is based on the first year of activities of the network, which are intended to last 40 months and are designed around the overlapping activities of connecting, orchestrating and contextualising stakeholders. The paper describes the elements of the stakeholder engagement plan as deployed by the STELLAR network in TELeurope, the activities conducted so far, and the plans for the future. It explains the consortiums approach to stakeholder analysis, particularly the adaptation of existing methodologies, to produce a numerical ranking of stakeholders, by alliance potential. With regards to TELeurope, an emerging social platform being deployed by the STELLAR consortium so as to help this process of networking, it explains the current state of the affairs and plans for development of the platform, while referencing the work of Svensen & Laberge, and adapts the work of Bryson to contextualise these activities within a broader theoretical framework. Finally, the paper considers the quality monitoring elements and evaluation approach of the consortium, and makes recommendations as to how the networking strategy can be further energised, and as to how the process of evaluation can be improved. It concludes that the TELeurope strategy shows a high potential for stimulating engagement of stakeholders, subject to a number of caveats, which can be avoided through judicious policy choices within the next year.","","-0.2379","-0.2268","8","Building with stakeholders, Case study, Community building","Building with stakeholders, Case study, Community building","",""

Les deux questions de recherche auxquelles nous tentons de répondre ici sont : (1) quelles sont les questions qui se posent à un enseignant qui introduit des jeux dans sa classe ? et (2) quel processus d'adoption peut-on observer chez des enseignants introduisant un jeu dans leur classe pour la première fois ? Les jeux étudiés ici ont une composante numérique plus ou moins présente, allant des jeux vidéo au scenario pédagogique intégrant une courte phase de jeu médiatisé. Cet article propose une grille de questions élaborées à partir d'une revue de la littérature et d'une série d'entretiens, ainsi qu'un modèle d'adoption basé sur la théorie de la diffusion de l'innovation de Rogers et une étude de cas.

We focus on formal education and consider not only digital (educational) games but also other game-like activities such as role-plays and simulations. In tackling the matter of adoption, this paper addresses a key issue: How does the adoption process unfold when teachers introduce games in their classes for the first time? To answer this question, Roger's \"Diffusion of Innovations\" theory was used as the conceptual framework for analysing a case study. The case study took place in France with a group of six high school teachers who introduced three different games, in teams of two. We also provide different tools to support the adoption process: resources, activities, questionnaires, pedagogical scenario, patterns of activities and scenarios. Our efforts to support teachers' adoption and use of GBL are not designed to offer a one-size-fits-all solution. Rather, they are aimed at providing tools to foster reflection and facilitate the adoption process. It is hoped that this work will help overcome some teachers' resistance to GBL, and this will be the subject of further verification.","","0.3474","-0.2326","4","Game based learning","Game based learning","",""

As well as accommodation of technology in its ever-diversifying forms, there is a fundamental need to enhance learning processes through evolution in pedagogical approaches, so as to make learning in formal education more engaging and, it is hoped, more effective. One opportunity attracting particularly close attention is Serious Games (SG), which offer considerable potential for facilitating both informal and formal learning. SG appear to offer the chance to \"hook\" today's (largely) digital-native generation of young learners, who are at risk of falling into an ever-widening gap between \"networked\" lifestyles and the relative stagnant environment they experience in school and university. However, there are a number of inhibitors preventing wider SG take-up in mainstream education. This paper investigates SG in formal education, initially by concentrating on pedagogical issues from two different but complementary perspectives, game design and game deployment. It then goes on to examine game based practice in formal settings and focuses on the pivotal role of the educator within the emerging panorama. This is followed by a brief look at some specific implementation strategies, collaboration and game building, which are opening up new possibilities. Finally some points for further consideration are offered.","","0.5726","-0.0994","4","Game based learning","Game based learning","",""

The study investigated the mechanisms of group membership and their participatory dynamics in terms of group types (generic vs. thematic), duration of membership and the interplay between offline and online activities. Results showed that groups differing in terms of domain (generic or thematic) are characterized by particular mechanisms of affiliation and participation and that mechanisms of legitimation of the members, aswell as of shared resources, are associated with the duration of membership.
