In addition, it can be used as an anode biocatalyst for enzymatic biofuel cells to power miniaturised sensor?transmitter systems. Various electrode materials and designs have been tested in the past decade to utilize and enhance the direct electron transfer (DET) from the enzyme to the electrode. Additionally, mediated electron transfer (MET) approaches via soluble redox mediators and redox polymers have been pursued. Biosensors for cellobiose, lactose and glucose determination are based on CDH from different fungal producers, which show differences with respect to substrate specificity, pH optima, DET efficiency and surface binding affinity. Biosensors for the detection of quinones and catecholamines can use carbohydrates for analyte regeneration and signal amplification. This review discusses different approaches to enhance the sensitivity and selectivity of CDH-based biosensors, which focus on (1) more efficient DET on chemically modified or nanostructured electrodes, (2) the synthesis of custom-made redox polymers for higher MET currents and (3) the engineering of enzymes and reaction pathways. Combination of these strategies will enable the design of sensitive and selective CDH-based biosensors with reduced electrode size for the detection of analytes in continuous on-site and point-of-care applications.","L 395","Open Access","-0.1154","0.2978","11","Carbohydrates","Carbohydrates",NA,NA,51,"",""

			Application of Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs) to sensor substrates holds great promise within the field of electrochemical sensing due to their low price, tailored selectivity and facile synthesis protocols. Though MIPs can be synthesised directly onto the surface of sensors via layer or film deposition, this can be difficult due to the high number of interdependent steps involved in their synthesis. For this reason, synthesis of MIP particles is more frequently employed by synthetic and non-specialist laboratories alike. There is, however a lack of immobilisation protocols for these particles. Herein, there is presented a sol-gel based immobilisation method for MIP particles for the development of an electrochemical sensor. The macroporous precipitation-polymerised particles were imprinted with Theophylline, combined with graphite in the sol-gel and deposited on an electrode surface. The sensor was tested using differential pulse voltammetry. A limit of detection of 1µM and a relative standard deviation of 6.85% was observed for the primary analyte. The electrode was regenerated via a thermal washing process with a signal loss of 29.3% following the initial regeneration and 2.35% per subsequent regeneration.","264772","Open Access","0.2998","-0.0041","7","Molecularly imprinted polymers (mip)","Molecularly imprinted polymers (mip)",NA,NA,14,"",""

Impedance was measured in a solution containing the redox system ferro/ferricyanide. The change in interfacial charge transfer resistance (Rct) experienced by the redox marker was recorded to confirm the formation of a complex between aptamer and the target (Cytc). A biotinylated antibody against cytochrome c was then used in a sandwich type of assay. The addition of streptavidin conjugated to gold nanoparticles and signal enhancement by treatment with silver led to a further increase in Rct. Under optimized conditions, a detection limit as low as 12 pM was obtained. Cross-reactivity against other serum proteins including fibrinogen, BSA and immunoglobulin G demonstrated improved selectivity.","264772","Open Access","-0.1178","-0.0297","5","Aptamer","Aptamer",NA,NA,17,"",""

The new indicators are noncovalently entrapped in polyurethane hydrogel D4 and feature absorption maxima in the range 660–710 nm and fluorescence emission maxima at 680–740 nm. Indicators have high molar absorption coefficients of ∼80 000 M–1 cm–1, good quantum yields (up to 20%), excellent photostability and low cross-sensitivity to the ionic strength. pK a values of indicators are determined from absorbance and fluorescence measurements and range from 7 to 11, depending on the substitution pattern of electron-donating and -withdrawing functionalities. Therefore, the new indicators are suitable for exploitation and adaptation in a diverse range of analytical applications. Apparent pK a values in sensor films derived from fluorescence data show 0.5–1 pH units lower values in comparison with those derived from the absorption data due to Förster resonance energy transfer from protonated to deprotonated form. A dual-lifetime referenced sensor is prepared, and application for monitoring of pH in corals is demonstrated.","264772","Open Access","0.6754","-0.0299","12","Article","Article",NA,NA,92,"",""

Its proposed function is reduction of lytic polysaccharide mono-oxygenase for subsequent cellulose depolymerization. Electrons are transferred from FADH2 in the catalytic flavodehydrogenase domain of CDH to haem?b in a mobile cytochrome domain, which acts as a mediator and transfers electrons towards the active site of lytic polysaccharide mono-oxygenase to activate oxygen. This vital role of the cytochrome domain is little understood, e.g. why do CDHs exhibit different pH optima and rates for inter-domain electron transfer (IET)? This study uses kinetic techniques and docking to assess the interaction of both domains and the resulting IET with regard to pH and ions. The results show that the reported elimination of IET at neutral or alkaline pH is caused by electrostatic repulsion, which prevents adoption of the closed conformation of CDH. Divalent alkali earth metal cations are shown to exert a bridging effect between the domains at concentrations of >?3?mm, thereby neutralizing electrostatic repulsion and increasing IET rates. The necessary high ion concentration, together with the docking results, show that this effect is not caused by specific cation binding sites, but by various clusters of Asp, Glu, Asn, Gln and the haem?b propionate group at the domain interface. The results show that a closed conformation of both CDH domains is necessary for IET, but the closed conformation also increases the FAD reduction rate by an electron pulling effect.","W 1224","Open Access","0.5643","0.2691","13","Oxidative cellulose degradation","Oxidative cellulose degradation",NA,NA,13,"",""
