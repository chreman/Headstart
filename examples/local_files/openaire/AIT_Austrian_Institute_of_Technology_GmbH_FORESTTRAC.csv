The sequencing of genomes of the size of the oak genome (740 Mb/C) is now becoming both possible and affordable due to breakthroughs in sequencing technology. However, an understanding of the composition and structure of the oak genome is required before launching a sequencing initiative. We constructed random (Rd) and hypomethylated (Hp) genomic libraries for pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) and carried out a sample sequencing of 2.33 and 2.36 Mb of shotgun DNA from the Rd and Hp libraries, respectively, to provide a first insight into the repetitive element and gene content of the oak genome. We found striking similarities between Rd sequences and previously analyzed BAC end sequences of pedunculate oak, with a similar percentage of known repeat elements (5.56%), an almost identical simple sequence repeat density (i.e., 29 SSRs per 100 kb), an identical profile of SSR motifs (in descending order of frequency—dinucleotide, pentanucleotide, trinucleotide, tetranucleotide, and hexanucleotide motifs). Conversely, the Hp fraction was, as expected, enriched in nuclear genes (2.44-fold enrichment). This enrichment was associated with a lower frequency of retrotransposons than for Rd sequences. We also identified twice as many SSR motifs in the Rd library as in the Hp library. This work provides useful information before opening a new chapter in oak genome sequencing.

Results of 250 years of common garden experiments show that most forest trees have evolved local adaptation, as evidenced by the adaptive differentiation of populations in quantitative traits, reflecting environmental conditions of population origins. On the basis of the patterns of quantitative variation for 19 adaptation-related traits studied in 59 tree species (mostly temperate and boreal species from the Northern hemisphere), we found that genetic differentiation between populations and clinal variation along environmental gradients were very common (respectively, 90% and 78% of cases). Thus, responding to climate change will likely require that the quantitative traits of populations again match their environments. We examine what kind of information is needed for evaluating the potential to respond, and what information is already available. We review the genetic models related to selection responses, and what is known currently about the genetic basis of the traits. We address special problems to be found at the range margins, and highlight the need for more modeling to understand specific issues at southern and northern margins. We need new common garden experiments for less known species. For extensively studied species, new experiments are needed outside the current ranges. Improving genomic information will allow better prediction of responses. Competitive and other interactions within species and interactions between species deserve more consideration. Despite the long generation times, the strong background in quantitative genetics and growing genomic resources make forest trees useful species for climate change research. The greatest adaptive response is expected when populations are large, have high genetic variability, selection is strong, and there is ecological opportunity for establishment of better adapted genotypes.","206734","Open Access","0.5069","-0.0689","3","Local adaptation","Local adaptation",227,"21","455","",""

Trees are capable of long-distance gene flow, which can promote adaptive evolution in novel environments by increasing genetic variation for fitness. It is unclear, however, if this can compensate for maladaptive effects of gene flow and for the long-generation times of trees. We critically review data on the extent of long-distance gene flow and summarise theory that allows us to predict evolutionary responses of trees to climate change. Estimates of long-distance gene flow based both on direct observations and on genetic methods provide evidence that genes can move over spatial scales larger than habitat shifts predicted under climate change within one generation. Both theoretical and empirical data suggest that the positive effects of gene flow on adaptation may dominate in many instances. The balance of positive to negative consequences of gene flow may, however, differ for leading edge, core and rear sections of forest distributions. We propose future experimental and theoretical research that would better integrate dispersal biology with evolutionary quantitative genetics and improve predictions of tree responses to climate change.","244096","Open Access","0.362","0.4576","4","Forest trees","Forest trees",208,"8","410","",""

This information may help to improve the conservation of adaptive genetic variation and the management of forests to increase their health and productivity. Deep-coverage large-insert genomic libraries are a crucial tool for attaining this objective. We report herein the construction of a BAC library for <it>Quercus robur</it>, its characterization and an analysis of BAC end sequences.</p> <p>Results</p> <p>The <it>Eco</it>RI library generated consisted of 92,160 clones, 7% of which had no insert. Levels of chloroplast and mitochondrial contamination were below 3% and 1%, respectively. Mean clone insert size was estimated at 135 kb. The library represents 12 haploid genome equivalents and, the likelihood of finding a particular oak sequence of interest is greater than 99%. Genome coverage was confirmed by PCR screening of the library with 60 unique genetic loci sampled from the genetic linkage map. In total, about 20,000 high-quality BAC end sequences (BESs) were generated by sequencing 15,000 clones. Roughly 5.88% of the combined BAC end sequence length corresponded to known retroelements while <it>ab initio </it>repeat detection methods identified 41 additional repeats. Collectively, characterized and novel repeats account for roughly 8.94% of the genome. Further analysis of the BESs revealed 1,823 putative genes suggesting at least 29,340 genes in the oak genome. BESs were aligned with the genome sequences of <it>Arabidopsis thaliana</it>, <it>Vitis vinifera </it>and <it>Populus trichocarpa</it>. One putative collinear microsyntenic region encoding an alcohol acyl transferase protein was observed between oak and chromosome 2 of <it>V. vinifera.</it></p> <p>Conclusions</p> <p>This BAC library provides a new resource for genomic studies, including SSR marker development, physical mapping, comparative genomics and genome sequencing. BES analysis provided insight into the structure of the oak genome.

Reasonably high levels of macrosynteny were observed between oak and chestnut. We also obtained diversity statistics for a subset of EST-SSRs, to support further population genetic analyses with gene-based markers. Finally, based on the orthologous relationships between the oak, <it>Arabidopsis</it>, grape, poplar, <it>Medicago</it>, and soybean genomes and the paralogous relationships between the 12 oak chromosomes, we propose an evolutionary scenario of the 12 oak chromosomes from the eudicot ancestral karyotype.</p> <p>Conclusions</p> <p>This study provides map locations for a large set of EST-SSRs in two oak species of recognized biological importance in natural ecosystems.
