In France, the Callovo-Oxfordian formation (COx) is a potential candidate for a nuclear waste repository. The redox reactivity (kinetics and thermodynamic redox potential) of COx clay rock samples are already under study using microscopic, spectrometric and wet analysis techniques. In order to cross and overcome certain limits by improvement in the knowledge, specific electrodes should be constructed and devoted to the deepening of the electrochemical behaviour of the COx system in different situations. Iron is one of the most common redox species in soils and sedimentary rocks. Iron-bearing phyllosilicates play key roles in various biogeochemical processes. The complexity of the physical and chemical (along with structural) changes involving their structural iron makes the studies of its redox properties challenging. Most of the recent reported efforts were focused on probing Fe redox on finely powdered clay (and often micas) particles, and have been hampered by inadequate interactions between particles and electrodes. Moreover, such experiments usually involve redox probe ions, thus adding supplementary difficulties in the determination of structural iron redox parameters such as redox potential (Eh) and kinetics. The present study aims at qualitatively investigating the above mentioned phenomena on minerals like iron-bearing micas. In the current work, we present initial insights regarding efforts to build a direct electrical interface between solid electrodes and conveniently shaped macroscopic mica crystals in order to investigate the redox properties of structural iron in dry and aqueous environments, in the presence of representative perturbations. A classical three electrode system has been used for voltammetric measurements. Platinum plate (1cm²) was the counter electrode. Potentials have been measured against either silver-silver chloride electrode (Ag-AgCl/3M KCl) or Saturated Calomel Electrode (SCE/KClsat) as reference electrodes. Open Circuit Potential (OCP) measurements and Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) were realised as well as Long term OCP measurements, along with pH and other parameters, are also measured. Most of the experiments discussed here have been conducted in unbuffered NaCl or KCl 0.1 M solutions, at 25°C. Anoxic conditions were maintained by first bubbling N2 and then maintaining a gas layer in the head space of the reactor. Long term measurements showed that in these conditions, pH stays at a value around 8.9 and is stable for several weeks. Experiments realised in buffered solution, at pH 7.5, using 1 mM Piperazine-1,4-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (PIPES) and 2 mM NaOH did not show any observable change. In some experiments, 5 mM ferricyanide (Fe(CN)63-) have also been used as a redox probe. High resistivities previously have been reported for this type of material, ranging from 1010 to 1015 Ω.cm at room temperature. Given the current flows detection limit of the apparatus used for measuring (~nA), the mm-thick pieces used in first experiments should normally behave like insulating screens on Ag (or maybe Cu-Ag) electrodes, e.g. no current could be measured across the sample with low iron content. OCP measurement consists in measuring the electrode rest potential against a reference electrode, in absence of observable current. It provides a first indication on the type of material present on the support electrode; normally no potential should be measured in absence of an electrically conductive path. Unfortunately, first records showed that OCP can be measured immediately after the immersion of all the first electrodes prepared (Figure 1, left) even on muscovite and lepidolite, clearly indicating the presence of water in the different samples. However, signals obtained for lepidolite and muscovite are less stable and can only be conveniently recorded in absence of external perturbation around the electrode such as vibration or even air movement, whereas signals obtained for the different biotite samples are very stable. Changing parameters in the electrolyte such as pH (figure 1, right) removal of O2, or change in Cl- does not seems to affect the measured OCP of this type of electrode as it stay stable for days. Several week-longs monitoring on ten biotite electrodes, dipped in unbuffered NaCl 0.1 M, showed that the OCP slowly decreases and stays stable, at values between 0.1 and 0.14 mV/NHE (data not shown), despite occasional pH oscillation between 4 and 9. Results of these experiments show that several aspects of the designs of such electrodes have to be improved for further experiments. From these observations, we can't preclude that water might participate in the electrical contact between the support electrode and the solution, but we can still hypothesize that it could be due to interlayer traces of water, offering a poorly electrically conductive path in lepidolite and muscovite, whereas another mechanism might participate in the biotite sample. First, lowering of the water content in the mineral must be realised, using smaller crystals, longer drying and vacuuming time, and using more penetrating and impregnating resins. Platinum plates and evaporated platinum or carbon are envisioned for the inert support electrode. Using thinned slices should reduce electrical resistivity of the whole bulk structure, allowing a more convenient observation of the coupled electrons transfers that might occur between separated crystal surfaces. Hence, more suitable cutting techniques, such as wire sawing, should be planned to obtain thinner slices. More mica samples must also be selected, with higher and lower iron contents than the one used in the present experiments. This first set of experiments in interfacing solid electrodes and conveniently shaped mica crystals offers hope that this will be a valuable technique for probing structural iron. .","212287","Open Access","-0.3985","-0.2954","12","Computed redox potential, Iron electrochemical properties, Electrode for nuclear","Computed redox potential, Iron electrochemical properties, Electrode for nuclear",NA,NA,NA,"",""

Because, each electrode response depends upon its material nature as well as its surface properties, gold (Au) and glassy carbon (GC) electrodes were investigated as inert indicator electrodes (IIE) in addition to platinum (Pt). Indeed, platinum differs from gold as it has the higher exchange current density (10 mA/cm² for Pt, against 0.3 mA/cm² for Au). However, gold is known as a more inert material: Pt is susceptible to catalyze reactions, form oxides and adsorb H2; in contrast, gold does not. Gold has moreover a greater potential range (-0.8 to 1.8 V/NHE) towards the positive potentials (≈ 400 mV) than Pt. In comparison, glassy carbon possesses a larger potential range (-1.0 to 1.0 V/NHE) towards the negative potentials (≈- 200 mV) than Au and Pt. In addition to inert indicator electrodes pure pyrite (FeS2) was selected as alterable or alternative electrode. Its interest for potentiometric measurements in bio-leaching has already been demonstrated by Cabral and Ignatiadis (2001). It was even more interesting because pyrite occurs naturally in the Callovo-Oxfordian (COx) formation. It was thus of a great interest to integrate it to the bunch of electrodes and to identify the relevance of different redox reactions at the vicinity of the pyrite electrode surface. The test offered an advantage of great importance, because it provided information on the simultaneous behaviour of different electrodes under identical conditions. Electrode performances and robustness were examined versus time \"long term measurements\". This work also aimed to: - identify the redox reactions controlling the measured potential, both into solution and at the electrode/solution interface - compare the obtained results with speciation measurements and geochemical modelling. Because Fe3+/Fe2+ couple has thus a decisive influence on the behaviour of pyrite electrode, the robustness of the complementary approaches to obtain the voltage measurement it-self and its interpretation was investigated in low organic matter content samples where iron redox-active species dominated redox reactions. [Fe3+]/[Fe2+] ratios were analysed in different supporting electrolytes (NaCl, CaCl2 and MgCl2) at different pH (ranging from 1 to 12) and/or ionic strengths (supporting electrolytes concentration ranged from 0.1 to 5 mol.L-1). Investigations were also conducted in not balanced systems: i) Fe° powder immersed in pH-buffered and unbuffered solutions, ii) mackinawite suspension. PHREEQC® geochemical code was used to determine Eh and aqueous speciation by thermodynamic methods with the appropriate associated thermodynamic database (THERMODEM® thermodynamic database generated by BRGM). Potentiometric measurements demonstrated that the potential acquired by all the immersed IIE generally converges to a value of the same order of magnitude, independently of the sample. Acquired potentials were in good agreement with modelling. This fact demonstrates that, under the same experimental conditions, the redox couples fixe identically the potential of inert electrodes (i.e. outcome of the same equilibrium state whatever the inert electrode). In the case when acquired potential did not converge, interface phenomena occurred (adsorption, oxidation, reduction, precipitation, accumulation of ions...). Concerning FeS2 electrode, different behaviours have been observed as a function of pH: - Pyrite behaviour in acidic media (pH ≤ 2): pyrite electrode acquired a potential which was increasingly lower than that of the platinum, which measures the redox potential of the solution. The lower value of pyrite at this pH can be explained by the interfacial pyrite oxidation, leading to the increase in Fe2+ at the vicinity of pyrite electrode. As the pyrite electrode has Nernstian behaviour (Cabral et Ignatiadis, 2001), the equilibrium value is decreased because the Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio at the electrode interface is lower than that of the solution. - Pyrite behaviour at circum-neutral pH (4.7 ≤pH ≤7.0): it is important to note that, at low ionic strength, the potential of both pyrite and platinum electrodes were practically identical. The similar voltage measured by the two electrodes implies that the processes at the vicinity of the electrodes were the same. This result is in agreement with those already obtained by Cabral et Ignatiadis (2001), demonstrating that, in particular conditions, pyrite can act as redox electrode. These conditions can, for example, be encountered in the initial COx formation. In comparison with acidic media, at low ionic strength, pyrite oxidation/dissolution is lowered. The increase in pH diminishes the oxidizing capacity of Fe3+. The redox potential is thus fixed, for the two electrodes (Pt and Py), via the Fe(OH)3/Fe2+ couple, which is dependent of Fe(OH)3 solubility as a function of pH. High ionic strength, leads to an increase in the oxidizing capacity of Fe3+ versus pyrite. It thus leads to an accumulation of Fe2+ at the vicinity of pyrite electrode, consequently generating progressive decrease in the Fe(III)/Fe(II) ratio at the pyrite/solution interface and thus in the electrode potential. - Pyrite behaviour under alkaline conditions (pH ≈ 9 or higher): a higher potential value of pyrite at these pH in comparison with the potential acquired by platinum can be explained by an anoblishment process on the pyrite surface. Indeed, at higher pH than 7 iron hydroxide coagulates and stabilizes chemically to form an iron hydroxide coating at the pyrite electrode surface. The combination of equation 1 and 5 leads to Fe3+ depletion in solution and in the pyrite/solution interface. Fe(OH)3 coating onto the pyrite electrode responsible for the lowering of pyrite oxidation/dissolution. According to the following reaction Fe3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+, pyrite resulting anoblisment lead to the decrease in pH at the electrode. When the solution redox potential (Pt) is fixed by Fe(OH)3(s)/FeOH+ couple (with Eeq = -1.14 - 0.06 log[FeOH+] -0.03log[OH-]), the pyrite electrode potential is fixed by Fe(OH)3(s)/Fe2+ couple (with Eeq = -1.46 - 0.06 log[Fe2+] -0.01 log[OH-]). These results confirmed, with absolute clarity, that the behaviour of pyrite is a function of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) ratio at the interface. These results are even more interesting because they lead to highlight the double interest of pyrite electrode as both redox and pH indicator when integrated in the bunch of electrodes. In fact, in natural conditions, i.e. those of initial COx formation, pyrite can operate as redox electrode (its potential is similar to that of an IIE). An increase of its potential versus the potential of an IIE can be correlated to an alkaline environment: pyrite electrode can thus behave as a pH indicator. This can be applied in the case of COx formation during its envisaged evolution as nuclear waste repository.","212287","Open Access","-0.5156","-0.2384","12","Computed redox potential, Iron electrochemical properties, Electrode for nuclear","Computed redox potential, Iron electrochemical properties, Electrode for nuclear",NA,NA,NA,"",""

Clay structure provides specific properties to this structural iron (Festr). A constantly growing set of studies focuses on Festr redox properties, interesting various research fields, such as agronomic study on soil's nutriments accessibility or organic matter growth, or even studies on heavy metals and radionuclides retention in clay barrier. Study on Festr redox properties remains however challenging. Clay' crystallographic structure rules Festr redox properties, but in return, Festr redox transformation has impact on this structure. The redox history of the clay (i.e. extent and number of prior redox cycles) influences both Festr redox properties and the way they evolve upon redox processes. Given the number and complexity of implied mechanisms, and given the variety of clay structures, this PhD thesis focuses on the particular group of dioctahedral smectites, more precisely on the iron rich end-members named nontronites and on the impact of Festr reduction on their structural properties. The studied reduction mechanism is itself restricted to reduction by powerful chemical reduces such as dithionite. Along with a critical review of available abundant literature on this specific aspect, experimental works have been conducted and several theoretical approaches have been discussed and developed to construct a structural model of Festr redox properties and their relations with the smectitic structure. New measures of clay negative layer charge as a function of reduction level done during this PhD clearly indicate, contrary to previously assumed behavior, negative layer charge do not monotonously increases upon Festr reduction, but shows a dramatic drop starting from a given reduction level. The reduction domain of a nontronite is thus spitted into two domains: the first is characterized by a negative layer charge increase and reversible structural changes; the second is characterized by a drop of the negative layer charge and less or even not reversible structural transformations. The models developed, during this PhD, are restricted to the first reduction sequence, i.e. the reversible one. A first empiric model allows modeling nontronite CEC changes from their unit-cell formula (which provides composition and charge) and using an empirical parameter which is common to a series of low tetrahedral-Fe-bearing nontronites for which experimental data are available. In a second approach, an algorithm simulating how Festr reduction progresses has been set up, allowing to link negative layer change of particular type of nontronites (tetrahedral-Fe-poor) to this empirical parameter, to the reduction mechanism itself, and to the structural properties of the sample and the way they evolve upon reduction. Following this, the whole of this set of information has been implemented in a thermodynamic model of Fetr reduction, making it possible to identify the required data (available or to acquire) for the establishment of a model constrained by structural information.; Le fer joue un rôle majeur dans un grand nombre de processus biogéochimiques impliquant des transferts d'électrons, c'est-à-dire des réactions redox. Les argiles forment une famille de minéraux ubiquitaires, dont certains membres contiennent du fer au sein de leur structure. La structure des argiles confère à ce fer structural (Festr) des propriétés redox spécifiques. Celles-ci font l'objet d'un nombre croissant d'études, portant sur divers domaines de recherche, allant des études agronomiques sur l'accessibilité des nutriments dans les sols ou sur la maturation de la matière organique, aux études sur la rétention des métaux lourds ou des radioéléments dans des barrières argileuses. L'étude des propriétés redox du Festr demeure toutefois un challenge scientifique. La structure cristallographique des argiles conditionne les propriétés redox du Festr, mais les transformations redox du Festr ont également en retour un impact sur cette structure. Les propriétés structurales de l'argile et la manière dont elles évoluent au cours des processus redox sont ainsi influencées par l'histoire redox de l'argile, c'est-à-dire l'étendue et le nombre de cycles redox qu'elle a pu subir. Etant donnés le nombre et la complexité des mécanismes mis en jeu, et étant donné la variété des structures argileuses, les travaux de cette thèse se sont focalisés sur le groupe particulier des smectites dioctaédriques, plus précisément sur les membres ferrugineux que sont les nontronites, et sur l'impact de la réduction de leur Festr sur leurs propriétés structurales. Le mécanisme de réduction étudié est lui-même restreint à la réduction par de puissants agents réducteurs chimiques de type dithionite. En parallèle à un travail de revue critique de l'abondante littérature disponible sur cet aspect spécifique, des travaux expérimentaux ont été conduits et plusieurs approches théoriques ont été discutées et développées pour conduire à un modèle structural des propriétés redox du Festr et de leur relations avec la structure smectitique. De nouvelles mesures de charge négatives du feuillet argileux en fonction du niveau de réduction, réalisées au cours de cette thèse, indiquent clairement que, contrairement au comportement précédemment supposé, la charge structurale du feuillet n'augmente pas de façon monotone avec la réduction du Festr , mais est marquée par une chute significative à partir d'un niveau de réduction donné. Le domaine de réduction d'une nontronite est ainsi divisé en deux domaines : le premier est marqué par une augmentation de la charge négative et des changements structuraux réversibles ; le second est caractérisé par une chute de la charge négative et des transformations structurales moins ou non réversibles. Les efforts de modélisation réalisés durant cette thèse se sont restreints à la première phase de réduction, c'est-à-dire la phase réversible. Un premier modèle empirique permet de modéliser l'évolution de la CEC de nontronites à partir de leur formule structurale (qui donne la composition et la charge) et d'un paramètre empirique qui est commun à une série de nontronites pour lesquelles des données sont disponibles. Dans un second temps, un algorithme mimant la progression de la réduction du fer structural a été mis au point, permettant de lier l'évolution de la charge négative d'un type particulier de nontronites (pauvre en fer tétraédrique) à ce paramètre empirique, au mécanisme de réduction lui-même, ainsi qu'aux propriétés structurales de l'échantillon et à la manière dont ces propriétés évoluent au cours de la réduction. L'ensemble de ces informations a ensuite été traduit dans un modèle thermodynamique de réduction des argiles, permettant d'identifier les données nécessaires (disponibles et à acquérir) à l'établissement d'un modèle contraint par les informations structurales.","212287","Open Access","-0.2926","-0.6091","6","Dioctahedral smectites, Structural iron reduction, Versus structural iron","Dioctahedral smectites, Structural iron reduction, Versus structural iron",NA,NA,NA,"",""

Amongst iron-bearing phases, phyllosilicates might play key roles in various bio-geochemical processes involving redox reactions, where structural Fe (Festr) can act as a renewable source/trap of electron. A large set of data from kinetics, spectroscopic or electrochemical studies on dioctahedral smectites demonstrates that reduction of Festr impacts many clay properties such as colour, layer charge, swelling pressure, colloidal properties that are linked to layer structural changes. Experiments also suggest that this mechanism is partly reversible, depending on type and properties of the primary oxidized clay, on how the reduction is induced (chemically and/or biologically) and on extent of iron reduction level. The complexity of the involved mechanisms makes the prediction of Festr redox properties challenging. For instance, only empirical models are currently available to quantify structural changes as a function of reduction level. However, a predictive and mechanistic model of these changes is a prerequisite to develop a thermodynamic model for Festr redox properties. In this contribution, we propose a mechanistic statistical model to explain 2:1 layer excess negative charge changes induced by structural Fe(III) to Fe(II) chemical reduction (by dithionite). This model completes this published by Drits and Manceau (2000) and was calibrated on data from our own and from the literature. Actually, a large number of studies on Festr redox properties (Eh and kinetics) neglects the major structural changes that occur during redox reactions of this material and that are partially reversible, and are focused in measuring a single Eh value. Actually, the complex relationship that exist between the different structural iron sites should lead to consider that not only one but several Fe(II)/Fe(III) poles (classes) must exist in the structure, thus exhibiting gradually decreasing Eh values. Hence, further developments of our model will include Crystal Field Theory (CFT) calculation to identify the variety of Festr redox potential, which arises from the varying Festr neighbouring inside the same structure and along the redox processes.","212287","Open Access","-0.3288","-0.4977","6","Dioctahedral smectites, Structural iron reduction, Versus structural iron","Dioctahedral smectites, Structural iron reduction, Versus structural iron",NA,NA,NA,"",""

A large fraction of the release is assumed to be a consequence of dissolution of the fuel matrix, UO2. In this doctoral thesis, the kinetics and the mechanisms behind oxidative U(IV) dissolution were studied. The eects of solid phase inclusions mimicking the presence of fission products, and solutes mimicking expected groundwater components were also evaluated. Palladium, as a model substance for noble metal particle (fission products) inclusions, was shown to catalyze surface oxidation of U(IV), as well as reduction of U(VI). The second order rate constant for the surface reduction of U(VI) by H2was found to be on the order of 10-6 m s-1 (diusion controlled). Under 40 bar H2, 1 wt.% Pd was sufficient to suppress oxidative U(IV) dissolution in 2mM H2O2 aqueous solution. During g γirradiation under 1 bar H2, 0.1 wt.% Pd were sufficient to completely suppress oxidative dissolution. Under inert conditions, where H2 is only produced radiolytically, complete inhibition is observed for 3 wt.% Pd. The presence of Y2O3 as a model substance for trivalent fission products was found to decrease U(VI) dissolution significantly under inert, as well as reducing conditions. Based on kinetic data, it was shown that pure competition kinetics cannot explain the observed decrease. From experiments using pure oxidants it was shown that Y2O3 doping of UO2 decreases the redox reactivity. In addition, from experiments where hydroxyl radical formation from the catalytic decomposition of H2O2 was monitored, it could be concluded that doping has a minor influence on this process. On the basis of numerical simulations, the H2 concentration necessary to suppressradiolytic H2O2 production was found to increase with an increase in dose rate or HCO-3 concentration. Furthermore, the steady state concentration of H2O2 was found to be inversely proportional to the H2 pressure, and proportional to the square root of the dose rate. Fe2 diers strongly from the total reaction volume, the actual dose rate should not be converted into a homogeneous dose rate in numerical simulations.

EXAFS spectroscopy, in combination with our theoretical model of the local structure surrounding the Se atom, confirms the possibility of selenite ion substituting for carbonate anion in the calcite structure.","212287","Open Access","-0.1195","-0.7153","14","Selenium","Selenium",25,NA,NA,"",""

Existing approaches, new data and model refinements","HADI, Jebril","2013-01-01","ELSEVIER","publication","","","","A model was developed to describe how the 2:1 layer excess negative charge induced by the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) by sodium dithionite buffered with citrate-bicarbonate is balanced and applied to nontronites. This model is based on new experimental data and extends structural interpretation introduced by a former model [36-38]. The 2:1 layer negative charge increase due to Fe(III) to Fe(II) reduction is balanced by an excess adsorption of cations in the clay interlayers and a specific sorption of H+ from solution. Prevalence of one compensating mechanism over the other is related to the growing lattice distortion induced by structural Fe(III) reduction. At low reduction levels, cation adsorption dominates and some of the incorporated protons react with structural OH groups, leading to a dehydroxylation of the structure. Starting from a moderate reduction level, other structural changes occur, leading to a reorganisation of the octahedral and tetrahedral lattice: migration or release of cations, intense dehydroxylation and bonding of protons to undersaturated oxygen atoms. Experimental data highlight some particular properties of ferruginous smectites regarding chemical reduction. Contrary to previous assumptions, the negative layer charge of nontronites does not only increase towards a plateau value upon reduction. A peak is observed in the reduction domain. After this peak, the negative layer charge decreases upon extended reduction (30%). The decrease is so dramatic that the layer charge of highly reduced nontronites can fall below that of its fully oxidised counterpart. Furthermore, the presence of a large amount of tetrahedral Fe seems to promote intense clay structural changes and Fe reducibility. Our newly acquired data clearly show that models currently available in the literature cannot be applied to the whole reduction range of clay structural Fe. Moreover, changes in the model normalising procedure clearly demonstrate that the investigated low tetrahedral bearing nontronites (SWa-1, GAN and NAu-1) all exhibit the same behaviour at low reduction levels. Consequently, we restricted our model to the case of moderate reduction (","212287","Restricted","-0.464","-0.5552","6","Dioctahedral smectites, Structural iron reduction, Versus structural iron","Dioctahedral smectites, Structural iron reduction, Versus structural iron",7,NA,NA,"",""

However, the oxidative dissolution yield, i.e. the ratio between the amount of dissolved uranium and the amount of consumed H2O2 is significantly lower for doped UO2. In this work we have studied the mechanistic difference between SIMFUEL and pure UO2. H2O2 can be catalytically decomposed on UO2 in competition with the redox process in which U(IV) is oxidized. The latter process leads to the dissolution of oxidized uranium. The first step in the catalytic decomposition is the formation of hydroxyl radicals. The presence of hydroxyl radicals was verified using Tris buffer as a radical scavenger. For both UO2 and SIMFUEL pellets, significant amounts of hydroxyl radicals were formed. The results also show that the difference in dissolution yield between the two materials can mainly be attributed to differences in the redox reactivity. Based on this, the rate constants for electron transfer were revised and the relative impact of the radiolytic oxidants in oxidative dissolution of UO2 and SIMFUEL pellets were calculated. The impact of H2O2 is shown to be slightly reduced.

However, the oxidative dissolution yield, i.e. the ratio between the amount of dissolved uranium and the amount of consumed H2O2 is significantly lower for doped UO2. The rationale for the observed differences in dissolution yield is a difference in the ratio between the rates of the two possible reactions between H2O2 and the doped UO2. In this work we have studied the effect of doping on the two possible reactions, electron-transfer and catalytic decomposition. The catalytic decomposition was studied by monitoring the hydroxyl radical production (the primary product) as a function of time. The redox reactivity of the doped pellets was studied by using MnO4- and IrCl62- as model oxidants, only capable of electron-transfer reactions with the pellets. In addition, the activation energies for oxidation of UO2 and SIMFUEL by MnO4- were determined experimentally. The experiments show that the rate of catalytic decomposition of H2O2 varies by 30% between the most and least reactive material. This is a negligible difference compared to the difference in oxidative dissolution yield. The redox reactivity study shows that doping UO2 influences the redox reactivity of the pellet. This is further illustrated by the observed activation energy difference for oxidation of UO2 and SIMFUEL by MnO4-. The redox reactivity study also shows that the sensitivity to dopants increases with decreasing reduction potential of the oxidant. These findings imply that the relative impact of radiolytic oxidants in oxidative dissolution of spent nuclear fuel must be reassessed taking the actual fuel composition into account.

With both minerals, competition between S(-II) and U(VI) for surface sites caused instantaneous release of adsorbed U(VI). Compared to lepidocrocite, consumption of S(-II)aq proceeded slower with hematite, but yielded maximum dissolved U concentrations that were more than 10 times higher, representing about one-third of the initially adsorbed U. Prolonged presence of S(-II)aq in experiments with hematite in combination with a larger release of adsorbed U(VI), enhanced the reduction of U(VI): after 24 h of reaction about 60–70% of U was in the form of U(IV), much higher than the 25% detected in the lepidocrocite suspensions. X-ray absorption spectra indicated that U(IV) in both hematite and lepidocrocite suspensions was not in the form of uraninite (UO2). Upon exposure to oxygen only part of U(IV) reoxidized, suggesting that monomeric U(IV) might have become incorporated in newly formed iron precipitates. Hence, sulfidization of Fe oxides can have diverse consequences for U mobility: in short-term, desorption of U(VI) increases U mobility, while reduction to U(IV) and its possible incorporation in Fe transformation products may lead to long-term U immobilization.","212287","Open Access","-0.4674","0.4889","15","Article","Article",1,"7","1","",""

In the present research, pressure-resistant, gas-tight circulating systems were constructed to enable the investigation of attached and unattached anaerobic microbial populations from a depth of 327 m in Olkiluoto under in situ pressure (2.4 MPa), diversity, dissolved gas and chemistry conditions. Three parallel flow cell cabinets were configured to allow observation of the influence on microbial metabolic activity of 11 mℳ methane, 11 mℳ methane plus 10 mℳ H2 or 2.1 mℳ O2 plus 7.9 mℳ N2 (that is, air). The concentrations of these gases and of organic acids and carbon, sulphur chemistry, pH and Eh, ATP, numbers of cultivable micro-organisms, and total numbers of cells and bacteriophages were subsequently recorded under batch conditions for 105 days. The system containing H2 and methane displayed microbial reduction of 0.7 mℳ sulphate to sulphide, whereas the system containing only methane resulted in 0.2 mℳ reduced sulphate. The system containing added air became inhibited and displayed no signs of microbial activity. Added H2 and methane induced increasing numbers of lysogenic bacteriophages per cell.

Redox conditions were defined by the absence or presence of ClO− as oxidizing agent (Na-salt, 5×10−3M and 5×10−2M). The high total Np concentration ([Np]tot ∼ 2×10−3M) led to the precipitation of solid phases in some of the samples. The carbonate concentration (as impurity of TMA-OH) was 2-3×10−3M. UV-vis/NIR spectra obtained from the supernatant in TMA-(OH, Cl) solutions and absence of ClO− showed clear Np(V) features, identified as NpO2+, NpO2CO3− and (NpO2)x(CO3)y(OH)zx−2y−z. No NIR features were observed within 800nm ≤ λ ≤ 1300nm for samples with ClO−. XANES edge energies and features of these samples confirmed the predominance of Np(V) in the absence of ClO− and Np(VI) in the presence of ClO−, by comparison to XANES reference spectra of Np(III/IV/V/VI) prepared within the present work by in-situ electrolysis.
