Thus, innovation, creativity and production of media should be emphasized also in the school of the future. However, current schooling system tends to produce consumers of media instead of creative problem solvers, critical thinkers, and producers of media. At this point also educators and policy makers should be creative and introduce innovative learning solutions and practices that support the development of creativity and 21 century skills. This paper replies to this call by considering learning by developing games as one of future learning strategies. Learning by developing games is not totally new idea, but the research has only begun to explore the possibilities that this pedagogical strategy provides. In this article we introduce a new game authoring environment MAGOS that is developed according to the framework of creative pedagogy. The framework of creative pedagogy comprises of three interrelated elements of creative teaching, teaching for creativity, and creative learning. From these three elements we derived eight design principles that guided the development of MAGOS environment. MAGOS supports creative teaching practices by providing different tools for planning and for teacher participation. Teaching for creativity is supported by offering an imaginative and innovative learning environment and tools with which a teacher can support students' creative and constructive processes. MAGOS include multiple elements that promote students' collaborative game development that is supposed to enhance co-creation of knowledge. MAGOS requires a joint effort for game development and enables building on each others' ideas through sharing and remixing other students' existing work. MAGOS also provides a tool that helps students to generate novel ideas for their joint game development.","258169","Restricted","0.4165","0.0322","9","Cognitive control, Game mechanics","Cognitive control, Game mechanics",NA,NA,NA,"",""

This study aims to characterise game dynamics in the adoption of multi-player GBL. In particular, we examine the multi-player GBL dynamics may enhance collaborative learning through a relation of positive interdependence while at the same time maintaining a certain level of competition for ensuring multi-player GBL gameplay. The first section of the paper introduces collaborative GBL and describes the combination of intragroup dynamics of cooperation and positive interdependence and an intergroup dynamic of competition to maintain gameplay. The second part of the paper describes two multi-player GBL scenarios: the multi-player game with interpersonal competition and the multiplayer game with intergroup competition. For each scenario a case analysis of existing collaborative games is provided, which may help instructional and game designers when defining the collaborative GBL dynamics. Technological requirements and best practices in the use of collaborative GBL are described in the last sections.","258169","Open Access","-0.1444","-0.3631","9","Cognitive control, Game mechanics","Cognitive control, Game mechanics",NA,NA,NA,"",""

Within such ecosystems, reusability is fundamental to software sustainability and cost-efficiency. Design for reusability brings the technical promise of high quality software that emerges from clean design, fitness for a purpose and a low defect count. This ensures the software is extensible to cater for or modifiable for different pipelines, data and purposes. Functionally, it facilitates the transition from Serious Games (SG) software projects that have been known to consume endless resources, and deliver expensive products, to successful SG projects in terms of quality, costs and timeframe. From an educational perspective, efforts at national and international level aim to increase the accessibility of serious game development via reusable, open components repositories. To enable SG researchers, developers, and implementers adopt reusability, it is necessary to create a gateway to reusable SG assets in the SG community. This would faciliate the SG community members to start exploring the large and rapidly growing body of literature on SG research, development and implementation, as well as on reuse for more detailed information on cost models, class libraries, organizational structures, repository management, knowledge reuse, and many other important issues. For SG reusability to reach its full potential this effort should not address exclusively the SG ecosystems but cross the boundaries of other disciplines and establishes the impact of reusable SG assets and knowledge has on related fields. Under these premises, the authors consider the development premises of a Serious Games Reusability Reference Point (SGREF) that aims to assist the SG community and also support transdisciplinary initiatives.","258169","Open Access","0.6486","0.0082","14","Awareness on shared, Supply chain management, Collaborative serious games","Awareness on shared, Supply chain management, Collaborative serious games",NA,NA,NA,"",""

In games, as in real life, narratives add layers of meaning and engage players by enhancing or clarifying content. From an educational perspective, narratives are a semiotic conduit for evoking critical thinking skills and promoting knowledge discovery/acquisition. While narrative is central to Serious Games (SG), the relationships between gameplay, narrative and pedagogy in SG design remain unclear, and narrative’s elemental influence on learning outcomes is not fully understood yet. This paper presents a purpose-processing methodology that aims to support the mapping of SG design patterns and pedagogical practices, allowing designers to create more meaningful SGs.

Learning by gaming is often seen as not serious enough within higher education and vocational training. Consequently, gaming as a teaching method is still often excluded from many curricula. Hence, students lack the experience of active knowledge acquisition during lessons and encounter a barrier for successful participation in serious games later. Although a variety of games have been developed and proved successful for the mediation of skills in complex systems (Windhoff, 2001), this paper discusses why we think that serious games should be considered as a suitable learning method for the mediation of skills needed in the education of engineers and secondly to give some examples of current games and experience of their use.","258169","Open Access","0.1885","-0.2502","7","Commercial outcomes, Comparing scotland, Computer games","Commercial outcomes, Comparing scotland, Computer games","2",NA,NA,"",""

Thus, the ability to share resources, innovate and to implement emergent ICT will play a key role for companies’ competitiveness and their sustainability. However, sharing resources puts high requirements on trust and gain sharing, amongst others. Although well known in supply chain management, the logistics sector is struggling to increase their shared resources.

In an attempt to improve and increase the attendees in this program, a game-like simulation was developed to represent transplant management procedural knowledge. To maximize the educational value, this game-like simulation was based on representative teaching cases to help students practice with different real situations and different levels of complexity in a risk-free environment. This study presents how an iterative game development methodology has been applied to evolve from a paper-based case teaching method to a game-like simulation, with a special focus on the efforts made to include the ONT experts’ tacit procedural knowledge in the simulation. Apart from increasing the number of students who can access the ONT training, this game-like simulation also helped to achieve a more detailed formalization of transplant management as well as a more comprehensive systematization of a set of relevant teaching cases.","258169","Open Access","0.7007","0.1623","6","Inteligencia artificial","Inteligencia artificial","0",NA,NA,"",""

The new model is useful to treat problems which are intrinsically not robust to small topological changes.

While problems related to the representation of the geometry of 3D shapes have been largely solved by the CG community, tools for coding, extracting, sharing, and retrieving the semantic content of 3D media are still far from satisfactory: interdisciplinary research efforts are needed to foster the development of the 3D Internet and its applications. The purpose of this paper is thus motivating research in this direction, presenting our vision of the future and, without offering any off-the-shelf solution, giving an overview of the various aspects of semantics required to optimise tasks and processes related to 3D content in different application domains.

EGDA has been applied to the creation of seven educational games in healthcare, and has been iteratively refined after each experience. EGDA is evaluated on two aspects. First, the effort and cost needed for creating these games is estimated and compared to current industry standards. Second, impact on knowledge acquisition and a student acceptance are discussed.

However, their effectiveness in terms of learning outcomes is still understudied mainly due to the complexity involved in assessing intangible measures.  A systematic approach—based on established principles and guidelines—is necessary to enhance the design of serious games, and many studies lack a rigorous assessment. An important aspect in the evaluation of serious games, like other educational tools, is user performance assessment. This is an important area of exploration because serious games are intended to evaluate the learning progress as well as the outcomes. This also emphasizes the importance of providing appropriate feedback to the player. Moreover, performance assessment enables adaptivity and personalization to meet individual needs in various aspects, such as learning styles, information provision rates, feedback, and so forth. This paper first reviews related literature regarding the educational effectiveness of serious games. It then discusses how to assess the learning impact of serious games and methods for competence and skill assessment.

The goal was to optimize the BCI individually in order to achieve high performance within few sessions for all users. Eight able-bodied volunteers, who were initially na?ve to the use of a BCI, participated in 10 sessions over a period of about 5 weeks. In an initial screening session, users were asked to perform the following seven mental tasks while multi-channel EEG was recorded: mental rotation, word association, auditory imagery, mental subtraction, spatial navigation, motor imagery of the left hand and motor imagery of both feet. Out of these seven mental tasks, the best 4-class combination as well as most reactive frequency band (between 8-30 Hz) was selected individually for online control. Classification was based on common spatial patterns and Fisher?s linear discriminant analysis. The number and time of classifier updates varied individually. Selection speed was increased by reducing trial length. To minimize differences in brain activity between sessions with and without feedback, sham feedback was provided in the screening and calibration runs in which usually no real-time feedback is shown. Selected task combinations and frequency ranges differed between users. The tasks that were included in the 4-class combination most often were (1) motor imagery of the left hand (2), one brain-teaser task (word association or mental subtraction) (3), mental rotation task and (4) one more dynamic imagery task (auditory imagery, spatial navigation, imagery of the feet). Participants achieved mean performances over sessions of 44-84% and peak performances in single-sessions of 58-93% in this user-centered 4-class BCI protocol. This protocol is highly adjustable to individual users and thus could increase the percentage of users who can gain and maintain BCI control. A high priority for future work is to examine this protocol with severely disabled users.","258169","Open Access","-0.1856","0.687","3","Brain computer interface, Based brain, Classification performance","Brain computer interface, Based brain, Classification performance","35",NA,NA,"",""

We thus assessed whether near-infrared spectroscopy recordings can reflect different demands on cognitive control during a simple game playing task. Sixteen healthy participants had to catch falling objects by pressing computer keys. These objects either fell randomly (RANDOM task), according to a known stimulus-response mapping applied by players (APPLY task) or according to a stimulus-response mapping that had to be learned (LEARN task). We found an increased change of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin during LEARN covering broad areas over right frontal, central and parietal cortex. Opposed to this, hemoglobin changes were less pronounced for RANDOM and APPLY. Along with the findings that fewer objects were caught during LEARN but stimulus-response mappings were successfully identified, we attribute the higher activations to an increased cognitive load when extracting an unknown mapping. This study therefore demonstrates a neuronal marker of cognitive control during gaming revealed by near-infrared spectroscopy recordings.","258169","Open Access","-0.3692","7e-04","9","Cognitive control, Game mechanics","Cognitive control, Game mechanics","3","15","22","",""

Curriculum integration is best done when components of the curriculum are connected and related in meaningful ways by both students and teachers. With the large uptake of SGs in education nowadays, one must consider SGs curriculum integration an issue at large since effectiveness of SGs use in training and education is getting more and more proponents. This paper looks at SGs curriculum integration issues from two perspectives- of the teacher connecting the content of the game and the learning outcomes into the whole educational context on the one hand, and of the researcher who sees the connection between the pedagogical state-of-art in SG and what realia can offer, on the other. By drawing on the experience of three teams of researchers and educators from Romania, Italy and Spain, based on common activities conducted by same partners and others in the Games and Learning Alliance (GaLA), an EC-funded Network of Excellence on SGs, joint perspectives over curriculum integration will be presented, with a view to sharing the experience in order to give guidelines for future extension of SGs into education and training, into well built curricula. The situations presented of SGs curriculum integration in the three different educational contexts are to showcase the framework for building a SGs curriculum design , the way SGs are effective for instruction, to present forms of integrating a SG into curriculum- how,where, how long, and showcase trans- and inter-disciplinarity within SG curriculum integration. A set of guidelines will be just a quick overview on what both practitioners, researchers and policy makers should consider for the near future in terms of SG curriculum integration, to enhance a lage-scale uptake of SGs into all levels of education and training, to better respond the 21st Century student and current social needs.

Evidence for and against the idea that dysfunctions in the mirror neuron system are involved in imitation and could be one underlying cause for ASD is discussed in this review. Neurofeedback interventions have reduced symptoms in children with ASD by self-regulation of brain rhythms. However, cortical deficiencies are not the only cause of these symptoms. Peripheral physiological activity, such as the heart rate and its variability, is closely linked to neurophysiological signals and associated with social engagement. Therefore, a combined approach targeting the interplay between brain, body, and behavior could be more effective. Brain-computer interface applications for combined neurofeedback and biofeedback treatment for children with ASD are currently nonexistent. To facilitate their use, we have designed an innovative game that includes social interactions and provides neural- and body-based feedback that corresponds directly to the underlying significance of the trained signals as well as to the behavior that is reinforced. © 2014 Friedrich, Suttie, Sivanathan, Lim, Louchart and Pineda.","258169","Open Access","-0.191","0.4544","12","6132 visual arts and design, Applications for combined, Autism spectrum","6132 visual arts and design, Applications for combined, Autism spectrum","15","1","152","",""

In a real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) setting, participants are immersed in cinematic experiences that simulate social situations. While viewing, their physiological reactions—including brain responses—are tracked, representing implicit and unconscious experiences of the on-going social situations. These reactions, in turn, are analyzed in real-time and fed back to modify the cinematic sequences they are viewing while being scanned. Due to the engaging cinematic content, the proposed setting focuses on living-by in terms of shared psycho-physiological epiphenomena of experience rather than active coping in terms of goal-oriented motor actions. It constitutes a means to parametrically modify stimuli that depict social situations and their broader environmental contexts. As an alternative to studying the variation of brain responses as a function of a priori fixed stimuli, this method can be applied to survey the range of stimuli that evoke similar responses across participants at particular brain regions of interest.

Based on our experience, we also propose a set of lessons and good practices to incentivize and better support deployment of SGs in HE courses.","258169","Open Access","0.528","-0.2764","11","Games curriculum integration, Deploying serious games, Education lessons learned","Games curriculum integration, Deploying serious games, Education lessons learned","4",NA,NA,"",""
