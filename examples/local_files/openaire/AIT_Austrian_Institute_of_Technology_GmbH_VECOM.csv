ELSA is an integrated model for capturing the whole spray evolution, in particular including primary break-up and secondary atomization. Two-dimensional simulations have been performed during the study, which is in fact enough to capture some of the main features of the spray, such as the spray penetration and the axial velocity. A mesh independence study has also been carried out in order to characterize the lowest mesh size that can be used to correctly characterize the spray. Furthermore, the two-equation k-epsilon turbulence model has been adjusted by changing some of the parameters of the dissipation rate transport equation in order to accurately characterize the spray. Finally some analyses of the results obtained, in terms of penetration, liquid mass fraction and droplet number and size, are presented in the last section of the paper. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

			spray atomization (ELSA) model for the simulation of Diesel sprays in cold starting con-
			ditions. Our main topic is to focus in the analysis of spray formation and its evolution
			&#9702;at low temperature 255 K (&#8722;18 C) and nonevaporative conditions. Spray behavior and
			several macroscopic properties, included the liquid spray penetration, and cone angle
			are also characterized. This study has been carried out using different ambient temper-
			ature and chamber pressure conditions. Additionally, the variations of several technical
			quantities, as the area coefficient and effective diameter are also studied. The results are
			compared with the latest experimental results in this field obtained in our institute. In
			the meantime, we also compare with the normal ambient temperature at 298 K (25&#9702; C)
			where the numerical validation of the model has shown a good agreement.

The present study uses an Eulerian-Lagrangian spray atomisation (ELSA) method which is an integrated model for capturing the whole spray evolution starting directly from injector nozzle still the end. Our goal in this study is to evaluate the ELSA model which is implementing into the commercial software Star-CD, for numerical modelling of diesel sprays. There are two key studies in these validations, at first we examine the turbulent parameters through the three different scenarios and then we study mesh dependency. The results show in form of liquid penetrations, droplet velocity, and axial velocity profiles.
