One science frontier is to identify plant assemblage and to optimize their biomass production, aided or not by amendment addition and cultural practices. A Cu-contaminated soil and a Cd/Pb/Zn-contaminated one were phytomanaged in controlled conditions. The combination of biochar and iron grit reduced the phytotoxicity in both soils. In a 2-year pot experiment, this amendment combination decreased the phytotoxicity of the Cu-contaminated soil, enhanced soil C sequestration and produced an uncontaminated biomass of Arundo donax L. and Populus nigra L. adapted for bioenergy production. These combinations of culture and amendment are tested in field trial at the Cu-contaminated site. In parallel, in microcosm experiment, out of 4 macrophytes commonly used in constructed wetlands (CW) to clean up aqueous matrices (i.e. Arundo donax L., Cyperus eragrostis Lam., Iris pseudacorus L. and Phalaris arundinacea L.), A. donax was the best adapted to produce a high Cu-rich root mat potentially usable as Cu-ecocatalyst. Clean up of a Bordeaux mixture effluent (BME, 69 μM Cu) by A. donax was tested in a pilot-scale CW. The BME was decontaminated in 48 hours, its Cu concentration being in compliance for indirect discharge of chemical industry effluents. However, after one BME circulation cycle, root Cu concentration of A. donax roots (623 ± 140 mg kg-1) was lower than threshold value for Cu-ecocatalysts (1000 mg kg-1) and successive treatments must be repeated to achieve required Cu concentration.; Le phytomanagement de matrices contaminées en métaux couple leur réhabilitation écologique avec la production de biomasses végétales pour la bioéconomie. Un front de science est d’identifier des assemblages végétaux et d’optimiser leur production, aidée ou non par l’ajout d’amendements. Le phytomanagement de deux sols, l’un contaminé en Cu, l’autre en Cd, Pb et Zn, a été testé en conditions contrôlées. L’emploi conjoint de biochar et de grenaille d’acier diminue la phytotoxicité des 2 sols. En pots, sur 2 ans, cette combinaison d’amendements séquestre du carbone, diminue la phytotoxicité du sol contaminé en Cu et produit une biomasse d’Arundo donax L. et de Populus nigra L. non contaminée, utilisable par le secteur de l’énergie. Ces modalités de culture et d’amendement ont été installées pour un suivi à long terme sur le site contaminé en Cu. Parallèlement, en microcosmes, parmi 4 macrophytes utilisées en zone humide construite (CW) pour décontaminer des matrices aqueuses (i.e. Arundo donax L., Cyperus eragrostis Lam., Iris pseudacorus L. et Phalaris arundinacea L.), A. donax est la mieux adaptée pour fournir des racines à forte concentration en Cu utilisables pour produire un écocatalyseur riche en Cu. Le phytomanagement d’un effluent de bouillie bordelaise (EB, 69 μM Cu) par A. donax a été testé en CW pilote. Il est décontaminé en 48h, sa concentration en Cu respectant la réglementation du rejet d’effluent en réseau d'assainissement. Cependant, après un cycle de circulation, la concentration en Cu des racines d’A. donax (623 ± 140 mg Cu kg-1) est inférieure aux besoins de l’éco-catalyse, et le cycle serait à répéter pour atteindre les 1000 mg Cu kg-1 requis.","266124","Open Access","0.0619","0.4604","9","À la bioéconomie, Assemblages végétaux pour, Biomasses à","À la bioéconomie, Assemblages végétaux pour, Biomasses à",NA,NA,NA,"",""

Phenotypic parameters (biomass production, shoot length, and visual symptoms) indicated a higher growth and a better fitness of M plants over 10 μM Cu. Plant Cu concentrations indicated root Cu retention (‘excluder’ phenotype) and a reduced root-to-shoot translocation with increasing Cu stress. Based on root soluble proteome energy metabolism was altered by Cu excess in both populations with stronger impacts in NM (glycolysis, Krebs cycle/oxidative phosphorylation). Changes in shoot proteome showed impacts on both light dependent and independent photosynthesis phases in both populations, and an enhanced need in S-containing amino-acids (up-regulation of cysteine/methionine synthases). In NM leaves, increase of enzymes involved in glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway and Calvin cycle indicated a stimulation of energy metabolism, while enhanced protein synthesis processes and protein chaperones suggested impacts on protein metabolism and increase of redox enzymes indicated a higher oxidative stress. Several over-expressed or accumulated proteins may be pivotal for Cu tolerance in M plants, for protecting protein metabolism (Heat shock protein 70kDa, roots and leaves), increasing anti-oxidative (ascorbate peroxidases, roots) – detoxification (Glutathione S-transferase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, roots) and proteolysis (peptidase and proteasome subunits) processes.; Des populations tolérante (métallicole: M) et sensible (non-métallicole: NM) d’Agrostis capillaris L. ont été exposées à des doses croissantes de Cu (1-50 μM) pour étudier la tolérance au Cu par une approche pluridisciplinaire. Selon les paramètres phénotypiques (biomasse, longueur des feuilles et symptômes visuels), les plantes M ont une meilleure croissance aux expositions supérieures à 10 μM Cu. Les concentrations en Cu des tissus reflètent une rétention racinaire (phénotype d’exclusion) et une réduction de la translocation vers les feuilles quand le stress augmente. En excès de Cu, le protéome soluble racinaire présente des altérations du métabolisme énergétique chez M et NM, plus marquées chez NM (glycolyse, cycle de Krebs /phosphorylation oxydative). Le protéome foliaire indique des impacts sur les phases claires et obscures de la photosynthèse chez M et NM, et un besoin plus important en acides aminés soufrés (augmentation des cystéine et méthionine synthases). Chez NM, l’augmentation d’enzymes de la glycolyse, de la voie des pentoses phosphates et du cycle de Calvin indiquent un besoin énergétique accru, tandis que la stimulation des chaperonnes et des processus de synthèse protéique suggère des impacts sur le métabolisme des protéines et celle des enzymes redox un stress oxydatif plus fort. Plusieurs protéines, surexprimées ou accumulées, interviendraient dans la tolérance au Cu chez M, en protégeant le métabolisme des protéines (HSP70, racines et feuilles) et en augmentant les mécanismes anti-oxydants (ascorbate péroxydases), de détoxification (GST et aldéhyde déshydrogénase) et de protéolyse (peptidase et protéasomes, racines).","266124","Open Access","0.3208","0.6172","9","À la bioéconomie, Assemblages végétaux pour, Biomasses à","À la bioéconomie, Assemblages végétaux pour, Biomasses à",NA,NA,NA,"",""

The PTTE phytoavailability was characterized by growing dwarf beans on potted soils and analyzing their foliar PTTE concentrations. OM and DL, singly and in combination (OMDL), were effective to decrease foliar Cu, Cr, Zn, and As concentrations of beans, the lowest values being numerically for the OM plants. The soil treatments did not reduce the Cu and Zn mineral masses of the bean primary leaves, but those of Cr and As decreased for the OM and DL plants. The Cu concentration in SPW was increased in the OM soil and remained unchanged in the DL and OMDL soils. The available Cu measured by DGT used to assess the soil exposure intensity correlated with the foliar Cu concentration. The Zn concentrations in SPW were reduced in the DL soil.

Cultivable rhizosphere bacteria and root endophytes were isolated from willow (cv. Tora) growing on a metal-contaminated soil. All isolated strains were tested for their metal resistance and potential to promote plant growth. The two most promising strains were selected and were equipped with the pTOM plasmid coding for toluene degradation. Both transconjugants were inoculated separately and combined in willow cuttings exposed to mixed Cd-toluene contamination, and their effect on phytotoxicity, Cd uptake, and toluene evapotranspiration was evaluated. Many of the isolated strains tested positive for the production of siderophores, organic acids, and indole acetic acid (IAA) and showed increased Cd resistance. The Cd-resistant, siderophore-producing rhizosphere strain Burkholderia sp. HU001 and the Cd-resistant root endophyte Pseudomonas sp. HU002, able to produce siderophores, organic acids, and IAA, were selected as receptors for conjugation with the toluene-degrading Burkholderia vietnamiensis BU61 as a donor of the pTOM-TCE plasmid. Although inoculation with the individual transconjugant strains had no effect on plant growth and negatively affected Cd uptake, their combined inoculation resulted in an increased shoot biomass upon Cd-toluene exposure did not affect Cd uptake and strongly reduced evapotranspiration of toluene to the atmosphere. In this study, inoculation of willow with a consortium of plant-associated bacteria equipped with the appropriate characteristics resulted in an improved phytoremediation of a mixed Cd-toluene contamination: the degradation of toluene was improved leading to a decreased toxicity and evapotranspiration, while Cd uptake and translocation were not affected.

In the present work a novel artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed as an alternative rapid and accurate tool for the prediction of Cr concentration in dwarf bean leaves grown in the laboratory on phytoremediated contaminated soils treated with different amendments. First, sixteen (4×4) soil samples were harvested from a phytoremediated contaminated site located in south-western France. Second, a series of measurements were performed on the soil samples. The inputs are the soil amendment, the soil pH, the soil electrical conductivity and the dissolved organic carbon of the soil, and the output is the concentration of Cr in the dwarf bean leaves. Third, an ANN model was developed and its performance was evaluated using a test data set and then applied to predict the exposition of the bean leaves to the Cr concentration versus the soil inputs. The performance of the ANN method was compared with the traditional multi linear regressions method using the training and test data sets. The results of this study show that the ANN model trained on experimental measurements can be successfully applied to the rapid prediction of plant exposition to Cr.","266124","Open Access","-0.3804","0.021","4","Neural network model, Phytoremediated contaminated soils","Neural network model, Phytoremediated contaminated soils",5,NA,NA,"",""

Conversely, one may be interested in the assessment of a given set of soil inputs that leads to given (target) soil outputs. This is the inverse of the former problem. In this study, we develop and test an inverse artificial neural network model for the prediction of the optimal soil treatment to reduce copper (Cu) toxicity assessed by a given target concentration of Cu in dwarf bean leaves (BL) from selected soil inputs. In this study the inputs are the soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and a given target toxicity value of Cu, whereas the output is the best treatment to reduce the given toxicity level. It is shown that the proposed method can successfully identify the best soil treatment from the soil properties (inputs). Two important challenges for optimal treatment prediction using neural networks are the non-uniqueness of the solution of the inverse problem and the inaccuracies in the measurement of the soil properties (inputs). It is shown that the neural network prediction model proposed can overcome both these challenges. It is also shown that the proposed inverse neural network method can potentially be applied with a high level of success to the phytoremediation of contaminated soils.

Intelligently applied GROs can provide: (a) rapid risk management via pathway control, through containment and stabilisation, coupled with a longer term removal or immobilisation/isolation of the contaminant source term; and (b) a range of additional economic (e.g. biomass generation), social (e.g. leisure and recreation) and environmental (e.g. CO2 sequestration) benefits. In order for these benefits to be optimised or indeed realised, effective stakeholder engagement is required. This paper reviews current sector practice in stakeholder engagement and its importance when implementing GRO and other remediation options. From this, knowledge gaps are identified, and strategies to promote more effective stakeholder engagement during GRO application are outlined. Further work is required on integrating stakeholder engagement strategies into decision support systems and tools for GRO (to raise the profile of the benefits of effective stakeholder engagement and participation, particularly with sector professionals), and developing criteria for the identification of different stakeholder profiles/categories. Demonstrator sites can make a significant contribution to stakeholder engagement via providing evidence on the effectiveness of GRO under varying site contexts and conditions. Effective and sustained engagement strategies however will be required to ensure that site risk is effectively managed over the longer-term, and that full potential benefits of GRO (e.g. CO2 sequestration, economic returns from biomass generation and “leverage” of marginal land, amenity and educational value, ecosystem services) are realised and communicated to stakeholders.

A pot experiment was conducted to determine the effects of three biochars and compost on plant growth and the immobilisation of Cu in a contaminated soil from a site formerly used for wood preservation. To assess Cu mobility, amended soils were analysed using leaching tests pre- and post-incubation, and post-growth. Amended and unamended soils were planted with sunflower, and the resulting plant material was assessed for yield and Cu concentration. All amendments significantly reduced leachable Cu compared to the unamended soil, however, the greatest reductions in leachable Cu were associated with the higher biochar application rate. The greatest improvements in plant yields were obtained with the higher application rate of biochar in combination with compost. The results suggest joint biochar and compost amendment reduces Cu mobility and can support biomass production on Cu-contaminated soils.

Pollutants can be then removed by harvesting plants. The success of phytoextraction depends on trace element availability to the roots and the ability of the plant to intercept, take up, and accumulate trace elements in shoots. Current phytoextraction practises either employ hyperaccumulators or fast-growing high biomass plants; the phytoextraction process may be enhanced by soil amendments that increase trace element availability in the soil. This review will focus on the role of plant-associated bacteria to enhance trace element availability in the rhizosphere. We report on the kind of bacteria typically found in association with trace element - tolerating or - accumulating plants and discuss how they can contribute to improve trace element uptake by plants and thus the efficiency and rate of phytoextraction. This enhanced trace element uptake can be attributed to a microbial modification of the absorptive properties of the roots such as increasing the root length and surface area and numbers of root hairs, or by increasing the plant availability of trace elements in the rhizosphere and the subsequent translocation to shoots via beneficial effects on plant growth, trace element complexation and alleviation of phytotoxicity. An analysis of data from literature shows that effects of bacterial inoculation on phytoextraction efficiency are currently inconsistent. Some key processes in plant-bacteria interactions and colonization by inoculated strains still need to be unravelled more in detail to allow full-scale application of bacteria assisted phytoremediation of trace element contaminated soils.

Therefore the cultivable seed endophytes of Agrostis capillaris growing on a long-term Cd/Ni-contaminated plot (Cd/Ni seeds) were compared with those originating from a non-contaminated plot (control seeds). We observed plant- and contaminant-dependent effects on the population composition between control and Cd/Ni seeds. Also differences in phenotypic characteristics were found: endophytes from Cd/Ni seeds exhibited more ACC deaminase activity and production of siderophores and IAA, while endophytes from control seeds, very surprisingly, showed more metal tolerance. Finally, the 3 most promising seed endophytes were selected based on their metal tolerance and plant growth promoting potential, and inoculated in Agrostis capillaris seedlings. In case of non-exposed plants, inoculation resulted in a significantly improved plant growth; after inoculation of Cd-exposed plants an increased Cd uptake was achieved without affecting plant growth. This indicates that inoculation of Agrostis with its seed endophytes might be beneficial for its establishment during phytoextraction and phytostabilisation of Cd-contaminated soils.

Willow is a metal phytoextractor of interest because it allows to combine a gradual contaminant removal with production of biomass that can be valorized in different ways. In this work two willow clones growing on a metal-contaminated site were selected: ‘Belgisch Rood’ (BR) with a moderate metal extraction capacity and ‘Tora’ (TO) with a twice as high metal accumulation. All cultivable bacteria associated with both willow clones were isolated and identified using 16SrDNA ARDRA analysis followed by 16SrDNA sequencing. Further all isolated bacteria were investigated for characteristics that might promote plant growth (production of siderophores, organic acids and indol acetic acid) and for their metal resistance. The genotypic and phenotypic characterization of the isolated bacteria showed that the TO endophytic bacterial population is more diverse and contains a higher percentage of metal-resistant plant growth promoting bacteria than the endophytic population associated with BR. We hypothesize that the difference in the metal accumulation capacity between BR and TO clones might be at least partly related to differences in characteristics of their associated bacterial population.

Bacterial metabolites, such as organic acids, siderophores, or biosurfactants, have been shown to mobilize metals, and their use to improve metal extraction has been proposed. In this study, the weathering capacities of, and Ni mobilization by, bacterial strains were evaluated. Minimal medium containing ground ultramafic rock was inoculated with either of two Arthrobacter strains: LA44 (indole acetic acid [IAA] producer) or SBA82 (siderophore producer, PO4 solubilizer, and IAA producer). Trace elements and organic compounds were determined in aliquots taken at different time intervals after inoculation. Trace metal fractionation was carried out on the remaining rock at the end of the experiment. The results suggest that the strains act upon different mineral phases. LA44 is a more efficient Ni mobilizer, apparently solubilizing Ni associated with Mn oxides, and this appeared to be related to oxalate production. SBA82 also leads to release of Ni and Mn, albeit to a much lower extent. In this case, the concurrent mobilization of Fe and Si indicates preferential weathering of Fe oxides and serpentine minerals, possibly related to the siderophore production capacity of the strain. The same bacterial strains were tested in a soil-plant system: the Ni hyperaccumulator Alyssum serpyllifolium subsp. malacitanum was grown in ultramafic soil in a rhizobox system and inoculated with each bacterial strain. At harvest, biomass production and shoot Ni concentrations were higher in plants from inoculated pots than from noninoculated pots. Ni yield was significantly enhanced in plants inoculated with LA44. These results suggest that Ni-mobilizing inoculants could be useful for improving Ni uptake by hyperaccumulator plants.","L 561","Open Access","0.3623","-0.2463","15","Food and beverages","Food and beverages",13,NA,NA,"",""
