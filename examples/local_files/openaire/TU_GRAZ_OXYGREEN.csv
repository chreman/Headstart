Using protein engineering, kinetics, microspectrophotometry, crystallography, and intermediate analogs, we have captured several snapshots along the catalytic cycle which highlight key features in enzyme catalysis. After acting as electron donor, the enzyme-bound NADP(H) forms an H-bond with the flavin cofactor. This interaction is critical for stabilizing the oxygen-activating flavin-peroxide intermediate that results from the reaction of the reduced cofactor with oxygen. An essential active-site arginine acts as anchoring element for proper binding of the ketone substrate. Its positively charged guanidinium group can enhance the propensity of the substrate to undergo a nucleophilic attack by the flavin-peroxide intermediate. Furthermore, the arginine side chain, together with the NADP(+) ribose group, forms the niche that hosts the negatively charged Criegee intermediate that is generated upon reaction of the substrate with the flavin-peroxide. The fascinating ability of Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases to catalyze a complex multistep catalytic reaction originates from concerted action of this Arg-NADP(H) pair and the flavin subsequently to promote flavin reduction, oxygen activation, tetrahedral intermediate formation, and product synthesis and release. The emerging picture is that these enzymes are mainly oxygen-activating and \"Criegee-stabilizing\" catalysts that act on any chemically suitable substrate that can diffuse into the active site, emphasizing their potential value as toolboxes for biocatalytic applications.","212281","Open Access","-0.078","0.394","5","Enzymology, Oxygen activation, Baeyer villiger","Enzymology, Oxygen activation, Baeyer villiger",NA,NA,NA,"",""

Tegenwoordig is het mogelijk om eigenschappen van enzymen aan te passen met behulp van “protein engineering” methodes. Het onderzoek dat beschreven wordt in dit proefschrift, focust zich voornamelijk op het modificeren van fenylaceton monooxygenase (PAMO), een enzym dat behoort tot de Baeyer–Villiger monooxygenase familie, tot een efficiëntere biokatalyst. Allereerst, is er geprobeerd om de coenzym en substraatspecificiteit aan te passen door plaats-gerichte mutagenese. Dit resulteerde in gematigde verbeteringen van de enzymeigenschappen, maar niettemin verbeterde het onze kennis over dit type enzymen. Door het beperkte succes van onze experimenten, hebben we de focus verlegd naar alternatieve methodes en hebben we gekozen voor het ontwikkelen van een activiteitsassay om mutant collecties te kunnen screenen. Deze nieuwe activiteitsassay is gebaseerd op het gebruik van een tweede enzym dat gekoppeld is aan de activiteit van PAMO en kon worden toegepast op het screenen van een grote hoeveelheid enzym varianten. Met behulp van gedetailleerde kennis over het actieve centrum van het enzym, het katalytisch mechanisme dat voortkomt uit structurele studies, modeleren, kinetische analyses en karakterisatie van varianten is het mogelijk geworden om banken te ontwerpen van hoge kwaliteit, terwijl efficiënte screeningsmethodes het mogelijk maken om verbeterde varianten te herkennen. Deze aanpak is succesvol gebleken voor PAMO en kan worden toegepast in het herontwerpen of aanpassen van andere (Baeyer–Villiger) monooxygenases, mede doordat de ontwikkelde screeningsmethode generiek is voor NADPH-verbruikende enzymen.","212281","Open Access","-0.5911","-0.3208","6","Het, Van, Baeyer villiger monooxygenases","Het, Van, Baeyer villiger monooxygenases",NA,NA,NA,"",""

Enzymen worden in toenemende mate gebruikt om puur chemische processen te vervangen. Door het stabiliseren van enzymen, het veranderen van enzymen zodat ze gewenste reacties kunnen katalyseren en door op andere manieren het gebruiken van enzymen toegankelijk te maken wordt een volgende stap richting industriele toepassingen gemaakt. De potentiele toepassingen van Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases reiken van hoogwaardige farmaceutische producten zoals prazolen en modafinil tot bulkchemicalien die gebruikt worden als basis voor bijvoorbeeld Plexiglas. Voor al deze toepassingen zijn patenten toegekend. De grotere toepasbaarheid van deze enzymen is op verschillende manieren bereikt. Twee verschillende enzymen met elk verschillende goede eigenschappen zijn gekruist, om zo te komen tot een hybride-enzym dat van beide de goede eigenschappen heeft overgenomen. Ook is gebruikt gemaakt van de steeds toenemende mogelijkheden van computer-ontwerp om nieuwe eigenschappen te introduceren. Op basis van een model van het enzym zijn stabilizerende veranderingen berekend, die vervolgens succesvol zijn toegepast in het enzym. In het kader van de bio-based economy is samen met een aantal partners in een NWO gefinancieerd TASC project gewerkt aan het produceren van een bouwsteen voor kunstof (in dit geval plexiglas) op basis van hernieuwbare grondstoffen. Verschillende Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases bleken in staat zijn de laatste stap in dit proces te katalyseren.

The selection of experimentally confirmed modifications is acquired from the latest UniProt and Phospho.ELM databases for training. The sequence vicinity of each modified residue is represented using amino acids physico-chemical features encoded using high quality indices (HQI) obtaining by automatic clustering of known indices extracted from AAindex database. For each type of the numerical representation, the method builds the ensemble of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) pattern classifiers, each optimising different objectives during the training (for example the recall, precision or area under the ROC curve (AUC)). The consensus is built using brainstorming technology, which combines multi-objective instances of machine learning algorithm, and the data fusion of different training objects representations, in order to boost the overall prediction accuracy of conserved short sequence motifs. The performance of AMS 4.0 is compared with the accuracy of previous versions, which were constructed using single machine learning methods (artificial neural networks, support vector machine). Our software improves the average AUC score of the earlier version by close to 7 % as calculated on the test datasets of all 88 PTM types. Moreover, for the selected most-difficult sequence motifs types it is able to improve the prediction performance by almost 32 %, when compared with previously used single machine learning methods. Summarising, the brainstorming consensus meta-learning methodology on the average boosts the AUC score up to around 89 %, averaged over all 88 PTM types. Detailed results for single machine learning methods and the consensus methodology are also provided, together with the comparison to previously published methods and state-of-the-art software tools.

First, an ensemble of heterogeneous ML algorithms is trained on available experimental data, then all solutions are gathered and a consensus is built between them. The final prediction is performed using a voting procedure, whereby the vote of each method is weighted according to a quality coefficient calculated using multivariable linear regression (MLR). The MLR optimization procedure is very fast, therefore no additional computational cost is introduced by using this jury approach. Here, brainstorming is applied to selecting actives from large collections of compounds relating to five diverse biological targets of medicinal interest, namely HIV-reverse transcriptase, cyclooxygenase-2, dihydrofolate reductase, estrogen receptor, and thrombin. The MDL Drug Data Report (MDDR) database was used for selecting known inhibitors for these protein targets, and experimental data was then used to train a set of machine learning methods. The benchmark dataset (available at http://bio.icm.edu.pl/∼darman/chemoinfo/benchmark.tar.gz) can be used for further testing of various clustering and machine learning methods when predicting the biological activity of compounds. Depending on the protein target, the overall recall value is raised by at least 20% in comparison to any single machine learning method (including ensemble methods like random forest) and unweighted simple majority voting procedures.","212281","Open Access","0.5212","0.1039","13","Post translational modifications, Prediction of post","Post translational modifications, Prediction of post",NA,NA,"11","",""

We investigated whether stabilizing disulfide bonds can be computationally designed based on a model structure. In our approach, unlike in previous disulfide engineering studies, short bonds spanning only a few residues were included. We used cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO), a Baeyer–Villiger monooxygenase (BVMO) from Acinetobacter sp. NCIMB9871 as the target enzyme. This enzyme has been the prototype BVMO for many biocatalytic studies even though it is notoriously labile. After creating a small library of mutant enzymes with introduced cysteine pairs and subsequent screening for improved thermostability, three stabilizing disulfide bonds were identified. The introduced disulfide bonds are all within 12 Å of each other, suggesting this particular region is critical for unfolding. This study shows that stabilizing disulfide bonds do not have to span many residues, as the most stabilizing disulfide bond, L323C–A325C, spans only one residue while it stabilizes the enzyme, as shown by a 6 °C increase in its apparent melting temperature.","212281","Open Access","0.0519","0.189","10","Based catalysis, Biological systems, Catalytic mechanisms","Based catalysis, Biological systems, Catalytic mechanisms","1","45","25","",""

Each monooxygenase can be expressed as soluble protein and has been tested for conversion of sulfides and ketones. Not only enantioselective sulfoxidations, but also enantioselective Baeyer-Villiger oxidations could be performed with this set of monooxygenases. Interestingly, in contrast to known class B flavoprotein monooxygenases, all studied biocatalysts showed no nicotinamide coenzyme preference. This feature coincides with the fact that the respective sequences appear to form a discrete group of sequence related proteins, distinct from the known class B flavoprotein monooxygenases subclasses: the so-called flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs), N-hydroxylating monooxygenases (NMOs) and Type I Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs). Taken together, these data reveal the existence of a new subclass of class B flavoprotein monooxygenases, which we coined as Type II FMOs, that can perform Baeyer-Villiger oxidations and accept both NADPH and NADH as coenzyme. The uncovered biocatalytic properties of the studied Type II FMOs make this newly recognized subclass of monooxygenases of potential interest for biocatalytic applications. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Flavin-containing monooxygenases are an attractive model system to study flavin-mediated oxygenation. In these enzymes, the NADP(H) cofactor is essential for stabilizing the flavin intermediate, which activates dioxygen and makes it ready to react with the substrate undergoing oxygenation. Our studies combine site-directed mutagenesis with the usage of NADP(+) analogues to dissect the specific roles of the cofactors and surrounding protein matrix. The highlight of this \"double-engineering\" approach is that subtle alterations in the hydrogen bonding and stereochemical environment can drastically alter the efficiency and outcome of the reaction with oxygen. This is illustrated by the seemingly marginal replacement of an Asn to Ser in the oxygen-reacting site, which inactivates the enzyme by effectively converting it into an oxidase. These data rationalize the effect of mutations that cause enzyme deficiency in patients affected by the fish odor syndrome. A crucial role of NADP(+) in the oxygenation reaction is to shield the reacting flavin N5 atom by H-bond interactions. A Tyr residue functions as backdoor that stabilizes this crucial binding conformation of the nicotinamide cofactor. A general concept emerging from this analysis is that the two alternative pathways of flavoprotein-oxygen reactivity (oxidation versus monooxygenation) are predicted to have very similar activation barriers. The necessity of fine tuning the hydrogen-bonding, electrostatics, and accessibility of the flavin will represent a challenge for the design and development of oxidases and monoxygenases for biotechnological applications.","212281","Open Access","0.096","0.4591","5","Enzymology, Oxygen activation, Baeyer villiger","Enzymology, Oxygen activation, Baeyer villiger",NA,NA,"29","",""

MuteinDB is broadly applicable to any known protein and their variants and makes mutagenesis and biochemical data searchable and comparable in a simple and easy-to-use manner. For the import of new mutein data, a simple, standardized, spreadsheet-based data format has been defined.

Using top-of-the-line homology detection method combined with transitive searches and fold recognition, we revised the realm of these superfamily in numerous databases of catalogued protein families and structures, and identified 10 new families of nucleotidyltransferase fold. These families include hundreds of previously uncharacterized and various poorly annotated proteins such as Fukutin/LICD, NFAT, FAM46, Mab-21 and NRAP. Some of these proteins seem to play novel important roles, not observed before for this superfamily, such as regulation of gene expression or choline incorporation into cell membrane. Importantly, within newly detected families we identified 25 novel superfamily members in human genome. Among these newly assigned members are proteins known to be involved in congenital muscular dystrophy, neurological diseases and retinal pigmentosa what sheds some new light on the molecular background of these genetic disorders. Twelve of new human nucleotidyltransferase fold proteins belong to Mab-21 family known to be involved in organogenesis and development.

In this study, regio- and enantio-selective proline hydroxylation with recombinant Escherichia coli expressing proline-4-hydroxylase (P4H) was investigated with respect to its interconnectivity to microbial physiology and metabolism. P4H production was found to depend on extracellular proline availability and on codon usage. Medium supplementation with proline did not alter p4h mRNA levels, indicating that P4H production depends on the availability of charged prolyl-tRNAs. Increasing the intracellular levels of soluble P4H did not result in an increase in resting cell activities above a certain threshold (depending on growth and assay temperature). Activities up to 5-fold higher were reached with permeabilized cells, confirming that host physiology and not the intracellular level of active P4H determines the achievable whole-cell proline hydroxylation activity. Metabolic flux analysis revealed that tricarboxylic acid cycle fluxes in growing biocatalytically active cells were significantly higher than proline hydroxylation rates. Remarkably, a catalysis-induced reduction of substrate uptake was observed, which correlated with reduced transcription of putA and putP, encoding proline dehydrogenase and the major proline transporter, respectively. These results provide evidence for a strong interference of catalytic activity with the regulation of proline uptake and metabolism. In terms of whole-cell biocatalyst efficiency, proline uptake and competition of P4H with proline catabolism are considered the most critical factors.","212281","Open Access","-0.2261","-0.6667","1","Escherichia coli, Proline hydroxylation","Escherichia coli, Proline hydroxylation",NA,NA,"11","",""

Besides the general modifiers of apoptosis, several tissue-specific regulators of this process were identified including HAX1 (HS-1 associated protein X-1) - an anti-apoptotic factor active in myeloid cells.

Although the whole three EF-hands fold is not preserved in vertebrate our analysis suggests that there is an existence of a potential single EF-hand calcium binding site in HAX1. The molecular mechanism of its action remains to be identified, but the risen hypothesis easily translates into previously reported lines of various data on the HAX1 biology as well as, provides us a direct link to the regulation of apoptosis.

This is especially true for redox biocatalysis where metabolically active cells are employed because of the cofactor/cosubstrate regenerative?capacity endogenous in the host. Recombinant Escherichia coli was used for overproducing proline-4-hydroxylase (P4H), a dioxygenase catalyzing the hydroxylation of free l-proline into trans-4-hydroxy-l-proline with a-ketoglutarate (a-KG) as cosubstrate. In this whole-cell biocatalyst, central carbon metabolism provides the required cosubstrate a-KG, coupling P4H biocatalytic performance directly to carbon metabolism and metabolic activity. By applying both experimental and computational biology tools, such as metabolic engineering and 13C-metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA), we investigated and quantitatively described the physiological, metabolic, and bioenergetic response of the whole-cell biocatalyst to the targeted bioconversion and identified possible metabolic bottlenecks for further rational pathway engineering. Results A proline degradation-deficient E. coli strain was constructed by deleting the putA gene encoding proline dehydrogenase. Whole-cell biotransformations with this mutant strain led not only to quantitative proline hydroxylation but also to a doubling of the specific trans-4-l-hydroxyproline (hyp) formation rate, compared to the wild type. Analysis of carbon flux through central metabolism of the mutant strain revealed that the increased a-KG demand for P4H activity did not enhance the a-KG generating flux, indicating a tightly regulated TCA cycle operation under the conditions studied. In the wild type strain, P4H synthesis and catalysis caused a reduction in biomass yield. Interestingly, the ?putA strain additionally compensated the associated ATP and NADH loss by reducing maintenance energy demands at comparably low glucose uptake rates, instead of increasing the TCA activity. Conclusions The putA knockout in recombinant E. coli BL21(DE3)(pLysS) was found to be promising for productive P4H catalysis not only in terms of biotransformation yield, but also regarding the rates for biotransformation and proline uptake and the yield of hyp on the energy source. The results indicate that, upon a putA knockout, the coupling of the TCA-cycle to proline hydroxylation via the cosubstrate a-KG becomes a key factor constraining and a target to further improve the efficiency of a-KG-dependent biotransformations.

In searching for new inhibitors of human 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (17beta-HSD 1) for the treatment of breast cancer or endometriosis, novel substances based on 15-substituted estrone were validated. We checked the specificity for different 17beta-HSD types and species. Compounds were tested for specificity in vitro not only towards recombinant human 17beta-HSD types 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7 but also against 17beta-HSD 1 of several other species including marmoset, pig, mouse, and rat. The latter are used in the processes of pharmacophore screening. We present the quantification of inhibitor preferences between human and animal models. Profound differences in the susceptibility to inhibition of steroid conversion among all 17beta-HSDs analyzed were observed. Especially, the rodent 17beta-HSDs 1 were significantly less sensitive to inhibition compared to the human ortholog, while the most similar inhibition pattern to the human 17beta-HSD 1 was obtained with the marmoset enzyme. Molecular docking experiments predicted estrone as the most potent inhibitor. The best performing compound in enzymatic assays was also highly ranked by docking scoring for the human enzyme. However, species-specific prediction of inhibitor performance by molecular docking was not possible. We show that experiments with good candidate compounds would out-select them in the rodent model during preclinical optimization steps. Potentially active human-relevant drugs, therefore, would no longer be further developed. Activity and efficacy screens in heterologous species systems must be evaluated with caution.","212281","Open Access","0.189","-0.3354","10","Based catalysis, Biological systems, Catalytic mechanisms","Based catalysis, Biological systems, Catalytic mechanisms",NA,NA,"10","",""
