This task also models the interactions across control<br/>boundaries and identifies sources of control conflicts, giving also an overview of experiences from<br/>the ELECTRA partners regarding the realization of controllers in demonstration and field test<br/>projects. The work was carried out during the period from May to December 2014.<br/>The different type of flexibility resources, their characteristics, affecting market mechanisms and<br/>potential for aggregation were researched using a survey among project partners. The parameters<br/>used to characterise flexibility include the amount of power modulation, the duration, the rate of<br/>change, the response time, the location, the availability, the controllability, etc. Views were also<br/>received how these parameters will develop until 2030 and what are the general trends for<br/>development of amount and controllability of this resource types. The parameters characterising<br/>different energy resources provide the technical requirements for their applicability to flexible<br/>operation of the grid and their suitability for frequency and voltage control now and in the future.<br/>Regarding the flexibility of electricity generation, gas turbines and other heat motors as<br/>reciprocating engines can be started quickest. The speed of power change is clearly the highest for<br/>heat motors and their minimum power is low. Also steam and combined heat and power plants<br/>can be utilised in the relatively quick increasing of the electricity generation. Slower power changes<br/>are possible also with the nuclear power but they cannot be carried out continuously. The<br/>regulation characteristics of hydro power are superb in comparison to the other electricity<br/>generation methods. Besides the sun power, wind power is increasing most quickly in the world in<br/>the coming years. The modern wind power plants are able to active and reactive power control.<br/>Storage systems can contribute to the frequency and voltage control mechanisms. Charging and<br/>discharging of the storage system at the right moments (response within milli-seconds to seconds)<br/>can help to preserve the balance between consumption and generation. Storages can also provide<br/>secondary and tertiary frequency control. Static compensation devices maintain desired voltage<br/>level by feeding the grid with necessary reactive power. FACTS devices and cross-border<br/>connections based on HVDC converter schemes can play an important role in frequency and<br/>voltage support. Demand response, including industrial loads and household devices and electric<br/>vehicles, will have great influence in flexible operation of the grid.<br/>This report describes appropriate models that characterize the interactions across control<br/>boundaries under normal and emergency situations, introducing suitable data rates and models of<br/>use by real-time control functions. In the future power system scheme, TSOs will be able to control<br/>significantly smaller part of the generation compared to the traditional centralized configuration,<br/>and thus they will not be able any more to compensate large deviations in the power balance.<br/>Moreover, increased electricity loads and sources such as EVs and residential PV systems, will<br/>influence the balance between day-ahead production and consumption schedule and will leave<br/>energy markets with higher and less predictable need for balancing power. The actors involved in<br/>the future grid control are balance responsible Party (BRP), cell system operator (CSO), cell<br/>operational information system (COIS), distribution system operator (DSO). Their respective roles<br/>are described and these actors play roles both to technical and market operations. Considering the<br/>web of cells concept developed in this project, the generation units will be smaller and in many<br/>cases these will be renewable resources which are less suitable for frequency control [1]. For that<br/>reason a more important role for participation at the demand side will be expected for voltage and<br/>frequency control in the future. The report describes “model based interfaces”, where the flexibility<br/>user and the flexibility contributor agree on a simplified model which describes the actual behaviour<br/>and constraints of the flexibility resource. Main outcomes of the work are the definition of controller conflict from a flexible power system perspective, a review of state of the art in power system control conflict and an outline of the methodology for identifying these conflicts during system operation and their impact on system stability. The report summaries the main findings from the literature and from project participant’s experience in terms of scenarios or examples of controller interactions resulting in conflict. A measure of controller conflict is presented for each example. This can be used as an indicator of the impact of controller conflict on system stability. Suggestions for resolving controller conflict are<br/>also presented. The report describes the methodology proposed to construct such a dynamic<br/>model for the purposes of extracting conflicting interactions of interest from the point of view<br/>frequency and voltage stability. From the voltage stability perspective there are many factors which<br/>may significantly influence the environment for voltage stability. It seems quite certain, that<br/>possible conflicts affecting voltage stability may occur mainly due to lack of proper coordination<br/>among players in the system voltage control and reactive power reserves management which are<br/>TSOs, DSOs, Generators and Aggregators. Generally the scenery foreseen for frequency, voltage<br/>and reactive power control in 2030+ is much more complicated than it is presently.<br/>An overview of experiences from the ELECTRA partners regarding the realization of controllers in<br/>demonstration and field test projects are also provided. It summarizes best practices and lessons<br/>learned which will provide valuable inputs for the implementation of control concepts and their<br/>testing and validation. The main requirements for controllers are reliability, fault tolerance and<br/>robustness.","609687","Open Access","0.1131","0.0546","6","Conflict, Control br, Stability","Conflict, Control br, Stability",NA,NA,NA,"",""

A time-domain approach is used to assess the transient stability for potentially critical faults. Potential critical fault locations are identified by a critical bus screening through analysis of pre-disturbance steady-state conditions. The identified buses are subject to a fast critical contingency screening determining the actual critical contingencies/buses. These two screenings aim at reducing the computational burden of the assessment, since only contingencies considered as critical are taken into account. The critical clearing times for the critical contingencies are determined. A preventive re-dispatch of generators to ensure a predefined minimum critical clearing time for faults at all buses is proposed, while costs are minimized. The results of the assessment are presented to the control room operator, who decides to accept the suggested dispatch or to repeat the assessment considering additional user-specific constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on a standard nine-bus and the New England test system.

The Power Hardware-In-the-Loop (PHIL) setup and the experimental results comparing the PPVC approach to traditional voltage control techniques are presented and discussed. The PPVC has demonstrated lower number of tap-changes and faster response to topology changes. To avoid simulation overrun in real-time environment, a slower simulation step is adopted for the electrical network model than the converter and grid emulator controller models in the Simulink model.

The PPVC improves the traditionally known secondary and tertiary voltage control schemes to develop a robust method coping with the emerging intermittent generation and variable loading in the distribution system. PPVC aims to utilize all available resources within a defined network area for voltage control purposes by taking loss minimization as an objective. To achieve that, the re-definition of voltage set-points in all controllable nodes within the area is performed using an Optimal Power Flow (OPF) algorithm. The proposed PPVC algorithm coordinates tap changers and other reactive power resources such as PV inverters proactively altering their settings for a recurring time-window. The settings are optimally computed by using short-term forecasted load and generation values. The PPVC algorithm has been implemented with MATLAB and the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) tool for optimization and evaluated on The European CIGRÉ MV network, modified with distributed energy resources (DERs). Simulation results showing the impact of PPVC compared to the business-as-usual (BaU) way of voltage control are presented. In addition, laboratory tests coupling the GAMS-based OPF with OPAL-RT have been conducted to present the efficiency of PPVC in real-time applications.","609687","Open Access","-0.195","0.2944","2","Post primary voltage, Power flow, Primary voltage control","Post primary voltage, Power flow, Primary voltage control",NA,NA,"0","",""

In this paper, a measurement-based, input/output, aggregate load model is proposed, suitable for dynamic simulations of distribution grids. The new model can simulate complex load dynamics by employing variable-order transfer functions. The minimum required model order is automatically determined through an iterative procedure. The applicability and accuracy of the proposed model are thoroughly evaluated under distinct loading conditions and network topologies using measurements acquired from a laboratory-scale test setup. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed model is compared against other conventional load models, using the mean absolute percentage error.","654113","Open Access","-0.6126","0.0649","8","Distribution grids","Distribution grids",NA,NA,"","",""

It is important to rapidly and efficiently respond to disturbances by, for example: utilising adaptive, wide-area protection schemes; proactive control of available grid resources (such as managing the fault level contribution from converter-interfaced generation) to optimise protection functionality; and taking post-fault action to ensure protection stability and optimal system operation. This paper analyses and highlights the protection functions which will be especially important to minimising the impact of disturbances in future power systems. These functions include: fast-acting wide-area protection methods using Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs); adaptive and “self-organising” protection under varying system conditions; protection with distributed Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs); enhanced fault ride-through; and pattern recognition based schemes. In particular, the paper illustrates how the increased availability of measurements and communications can enable improved protection functionality within distribution systems, which is especially important to accommodate the connection of highly-distributed generation at medium- and low-voltages.","609687","Open Access","0.3275","-0.4399","5","Adaptive protection","Adaptive protection",NA,NA,"","",""
