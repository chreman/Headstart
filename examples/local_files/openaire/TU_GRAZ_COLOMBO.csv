It is known how to compute the delay-minimizing optimal programs for single intersections or networks of them, if a static flow is assumed. But traffic flow changes on different time scales and many adaptive algorithms were developed, all of which adapt the green time durations, phase orders, and cycle lengths to the current traffic state. Evaluation of these more advanced traffic light control algorithms is more complex. The perfect control strategy is not known, so a comparison with a ground-truth is not possible. In literature many different metrics are used to evaluate the algorithms, but none of them are complete and they are difficult to compare with each other. This paper will derive a unified evaluation method for traffic control algorithms. As a first step a complete set of metrics with minimal overlap is determined. This set will include users’ perception, which is currently not used in literature to evaluate control algorithms, but shows significant added value. The second and last step is combining the metrics into one final criterion for evaluation by using a policy based scheme.","318622","Open Access","-0.0356","0.3998","11","Traffic light, Colombo deliverable, Verkehrsmanagement","Traffic light, Colombo deliverable, Verkehrsmanagement",NA,NA,NA,"",""

Emerging cooperative techniques like vehicle-to-infrastructure communication increase the knowledge about road traffic participants and open new channels for delivering information to these participants. However, most cooperative systems require large penetration rates in order to assure their functionality, making the first steps towards their deployment unattractive.
			COLOMBO overcomes this hurdle by delivering a set of modern, self-organizing traffic management algorithms designed for being applicable even at low penetration rates, asserting their usability from the very first deployment days on. COLOMBO focuses on two traffic management topics: traffic surveillance and advanced traffic light control algorithms. Herein, cost-efficiency and the reduction of vehicular emissions are the project’s key objectives. Both results lay the foundations for new, cost-effective and comprehensive way to measure and handle traffic. The results of COLOMBO include prototypes for incident and emission monitoring at intersections, for traffic state estimation based on fragmented data collected in low V2X equipment rate scenarios and for the self-organizing traffic control algorithm SWARM. A key aspect in the COLOMBO investigations is the use of advanced optimization techniques for tuning the parameter sets of the traffic control algorithms.
			These results have been achieved in tight cooperation of the project partners Graz University of Technology contributing PHEM, the German Aerospace Center DLR issuing SUMO, the University of Bologna who devised SWARM, the Université libre de Bruxelles which maintains irace and the Graduate School and Research Center in Communication Systems EURECOM.","318622","Open Access","-0.1761","-0.0128","9","Colombo deliverable, Verkehrsmanagement","Colombo deliverable, Verkehrsmanagement",NA,NA,NA,"",""

One of the challenges addressed is to be able to extrapolate mobility from detection processes, and then extract the estimated BT speed likelihood. Using BN, we will propose to link such likelihood to different a-priori knowledge of mobility states. Another challenge will be to integrate the BT and C2I speed likelihood, considering both processes have different properties.

The speed is computed using information sent by the traffic light. When entering the communication range of the TLS vehicles decide at what time they will pass the halting line and follow that plan.

Via V2X, so called cooperative awareness messages (CAM) are being received, which provide information on vehicle location and speed. Via Bluetooth,

A good reference for the exploitability of the COLOMBO results is the Technology Readiness Level (TRL), which is used in the document to indicate the maturity and marketability of the results.
			COLOMBO detection algorithms were developed for several situations. Data fusion between green phase duration and travel times from for instance navigation systems, can give useful estimates of traffic volumes. Full cooperative vehicles can give both queue estimates and traffic flow estimations and a work is being carried out on a separate traffic anomalies detection algorithm. Apart from the detection and traffic control algorithms, COLOMBO also developed and improved simulation tooling to facilitate the work in the project.
			The document also reviewed exploitation from a stakeholder perspective. Road operators and governments will profit from the availability of a lower cost alternative to current traffic control solutions both in initial investment and maintenance. Road users benefit from more efficient traffic control, resulting in lower travel time and fuel savings. Having a cooperative system in the vehicle also guarantees the queue the road user currently is in, has been detected by the controller. Therefore, cooperative vehicles are expected to have a lower average travel time.

One possible area of applications is traffic management. Traffic management requires data about the state of the road network. Before being able to predict or control traffic, according data is needed. The COLOMBO project, co-funded by the European Commission, examines the possibilities to use data gained via vehicular communications for traffic management purposes.","318622","Restricted","-0.3888","-0.1779","7","Computersystemsorganization computer-communicationnetworks","Computersystemsorganization computer-communicationnetworks",2,NA,NA,"",""

The work in this paper demonstrates a generic guideline for minimizing CO2 emissions at traffic lights. This was done using an adaptive control, which uses a cost function for optimization, rather than network-specific control parameters. A new version of the emission model PHEMlight was used, which added of a fuel cut-off mode during coasting and other improvements compared to the previous version. Using this model, it could be determined that the emission optimal ratio between delay time and stops for the cost function of an adaptive control should be 1:165 at 50km/h. When the speed limit increases the ratio also increases with 1:296 for 70km/h. However, it was also found that the optimal free flow travel speed was around 70km/h. Therefore with long distances between intersections and a low amount of average stops, the maximum speed should be higher than 50km/h for emission optimality. Application of the ratio for 50km/h to the adaptive control algorithm ImFlow resulted in a CO2 emission reduction of 6.3% compared to a vehicle actuated control.","318622","Closed Access","-0.2227","0.6206","8","Control and speed, Driving patterns reducing, Emission at traffic","Control and speed, Driving patterns reducing, Emission at traffic",0,NA,NA,"",""

			Contemporary traffic light control (TLC) systems rely on sensors for detection of traffic which are costly in purchase, installation and maintenance. Emerging cooperative technology offers an attractive alternative where only one road side unit per intersection is required, instead of several infrastructure sensors per lane. However, studies showed that traffic control with cooperative detection requires a penetration rate of at least 20% to function effectively. To show the potential of cooperative traffic control, this study presents three algorithms: (i) the SWARM control algorithm, which is designed to work with very low penetration rates; (ii) an extension to the adaptive control algorithm, ImFlow, which uses cooperative data for enhanced queue modelling; and (iii) an ImFlow extension to stabilise green planning to enable green light optimal speed advice. The results from micro-simulation show a 7.8% improvement for stops and delay time over traditional adaptive control for SWARM, and 14.9% for Cooperative ImFlow. Adding planning stabilisation reduced the average perceived change for end users from 9.0-2.3%, without performance loss for the overall traffic flow. This shows the large potential of cooperative traffic control.","318622","Restricted","-0.214","0.3203","9","Colombo deliverable, Verkehrsmanagement","Colombo deliverable, Verkehrsmanagement",0,NA,NA,"",""
