Here, Kirchhoff's diffraction theory is derived from the relativistic Dirac equation, thus reformulated to work on Dirac spinors. The parallels with the \"classic\" scalar theory are highlighted, and a basic interpretation of the result obtained for the Fraunhofer diffraction limit is given. The goal of this paper is to emphasize the similarity between the two equations on the most fundamental level.","246791","Open Access","-0.6915","-0.3592","11","Electron vortex beams, Physics - optics, Orbital angular momentum","Electron vortex beams, Physics - optics, Orbital angular momentum",NA,NA,NA,"",""

The present study developed radio-labeled iron oxide decorated multi-walled CNTs (MWNT) as dual magnetic resonance (MR) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging agents. Hybrids containing different amounts of iron oxide were synthesized by in situ generation. Physicochemical characterisations revealed the presence of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) granted the magnetic properties of the hybrids. Further comprehensive examinations including high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), fast Fourier transform simulations (FFT), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) assured the conformation of prepared SPION as γ-Fe2O3. High r2 relaxivities were obtained in both phantom and in vivo MRI compared to the clinically approved SPION Endorem®. The hybrids were successfully radio-labeled with technetium-99m through a functionalized bisphosphonate and enabled SPECT/CT imaging and γ-scintigraphy to quantitatively analyze the biodistribution in mice. No abnormality was found by histological examination and the presence of SPION and MWNT were identified by Perls stain and Neutral Red stain, respectively. TEM images of liver and spleen tissues showed the co-localization of SPION and MWNT within the same intracellular vesicles, indicating the in vivo stability of the hybrids after intravenous injection. The results demonstrated the capability of the present SPION-MWNT hybrids as dual MRI and SPECT contrast agents for in vivo use.","246791","Open Access","0.4755","-0.0585","3","Walled carbon nanotubes, Case study, Additional data file","Walled carbon nanotubes, Case study, Additional data file","38","41",NA,"",""

Such large coupling would be desirable for device applications but reproducibility would also be critical. To better understand the coupling, the properties of all 3 ferroic order parameters, elastic, electric, and magnetic, believed to be present in the material across a range of temperatures, are investigated. In high temperature elastic data, an anomaly is observed at the orthorhombic mm2 to tetragonal 4mm transition, Tot = 475 K, and a softening trend is observed as the temperature is increased toward 1300 K, where the material is known to become cubic. Thermal degradation makes it impos- sible to measure elastic behavior up to this temperature, however. In the low temperature region, there are elastic anomalies near ≈40 K and in the range 160–245 K. The former is interpreted as being due to a magnetic ordering transition and the latter is interpreted as a hysteretic regime of mixed rhom- bohedral and orthorhombic structures. Electrical and magnetic data collected below room temperature show anomalies at remarkably similar temperature ranges to the elastic data. These observations are used to suggest that the three order parameters in PZTFT are strongly coupled.","312483","Open Access","0.315","0.5563","1","Article, Interferometric methods, Magnetic properties","Article, Interferometric methods, Magnetic properties","23","23","1","",""

Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are an important sub-class of MOFs based on transition metals and imidazolate linkers. Continuous coatings of intergrown ZIF crystals require high rates of heterogeneous nucleation. In this work, substrates coated with zinc oxide layers are used, obtained by atomic layer deposition (ALD) or by magnetron sputtering, to provide the Zn2+ ions required for nucleation and localized growth of ZIF-8 films ([Zn(mim)(2)]; Hmim = 2-methylimidazolate). The obtained ZIF-8 films reveal the expected microporosity, as deduced from methanol adsorption studies using an environmentally controlled quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and comparison with bulk ZIF-8 reference data. The concept is transferable to other MOFs, and is applied to the formation of [Al(OH)(1,4-ndc)](n) (ndc = naphtalenedicarboxylate) thin films derived from Al2O3 nanolayers.","312483","Closed Access","-0.0222","0.6461","6","Antiferromagnetic order, Epitaxially strained, Mno thin films","Antiferromagnetic order, Epitaxially strained, Mno thin films","48","64","2","",""

Here, the effects of nanostructure and nanoscale conformal coating on the mechanical behavior of vertically aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays through experiments and simulation are systematically investigated. A modeling approach is developed and used to quantify the compressive strength and modulus of the CNT array under large deformation. The model accounts for the porous nanostructure, which contains multiple CNTs with random waviness, van der Waals interactions, fracture strain, contacts, and frictional forces. CNT array micropillars are grown and their porous nanostructure is controlled by the infiltration and deposition of thin conformal coatings using chemical vapor deposition. Flat-punch nanoindentation experiments reveal significant changes in material properties as a function of coating thickness. The simulations explain the experimental results and show the novel failure transition regime that changes from collective CNT buckling toward structural collapse due to fracture. The compressive strength and the elastic modulus increase exponentially as a function of the coating thickness and demonstrate a unique dependency on the CNT waviness. More interestingly, a design rule is identified that predicts the optimum coating thickness for porous materials.","312483","Closed Access","0.2703","0.5473","3","Walled carbon nanotubes, Case study, Additional data file","Walled carbon nanotubes, Case study, Additional data file","10",NA,NA,"",""

The spontaneous formation of surface strain-relief patterns in La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/LaAlO3 films results in lateral periodic modulations of the surface chemical potential and tetragonal distortion, controlling the spatial distribution of preferential nucleation sites and the bandwidth of the epilayer, respectively.

In this way, small nanorods of SnS are generated with sizes of ?10?20 nm embedded in amorphous carbon and self?assembled into a 3D porous interconnected nanocomposite. The SnS:C is directly deposited on the Ti foil as a current collector and neither conductive additives nor binder are needed for battery assembly.

			The assembly-disassembly-organisation-reassembly (ADOR) process has been used to disassemble a parent zeolite with the UOV structure type and then reassemble the resulting layers into a novel structure, IPC-12. The structure of the material has previously been predicted computationally and confirmed in our experiments using X-ray diffraction and atomic resolution STEM-HAADF electron microscopy. This is the first successful application of the ADOR process to a material with porous layers.

More interestingly, this CeO2/MgO catalyst showed outstanding stability in its redox response against high temperature aging treatments. Thus, after reduction in hydrogen at 950 degrees C and further oxidation at 500 degrees C, CeO2 reduction effects took still place at low temperatures, and no significant loss of oxygen storage capacity (OSC) was detected.

Selected patterns in the X-ray spectra identified by independent component analysis were found to be spatially and chemically representative of the matrix (γ) and precipitate phases (γ’) present in the superalloy, enabling their size, shape and distribution to be determined. The three dimensional chemical reconstruction of the microstructure may provide insight into the role of the various alloying elements in the evolution of the microstructure at the nano-scale.

The films were deposited by magnetron sputtering in reactive (Ar + CH4) and non-reactive (Ar) atmosphere with different Zr contents (from 0 to 14 at.%) in order to achieve a nanocomposite based films. With an increase of Zr content a broad peak was observed in X-ray diffraction spectra suggesting the presence of nanocrystalline (nc) ZrC phase for the coatings with Zr content higher than 4 at.%. The application of Scherrer formula yielded a grain sizes with a dimension of 1.0–2.2 nm. These results were supported by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showing typical charge transfer at Zr-C nanograins and carbon matrix interface. The nc-ZrC phase was also observed by transmission electron microscopy. The hardness of the coatings was approximately independent of Zr content. However, the Young modulus increased linearly. The residual stress of the coatings was strongly improved by the presence of nc-ZrC phase embedded in the a-C matrix. Finally, the incorporation of H into the matrix led to denser and harder films.","SFRH/BD/75071/2010","Open Access","-0.0366","0.4285","6","Antiferromagnetic order, Epitaxially strained, Mno thin films","Antiferromagnetic order, Epitaxially strained, Mno thin films","8",NA,NA,"",""

In this work, an alternative solution is presented that involves a glass tube coated on the inside with (silver-modified) TiO2 and spiraled around a UVA lamp. First, the spiral reactor is coated from the inside with TiO2 using an experimentally verified procedure that is optimized toward UV light transmission. This procedure is kept as simple as possible and involves a single casting step of a 1 wt% suspension of TiO2 in ethanol through the spiral. This results in a coated tube that absorbs nearly all incident UV light under the experimental conditions used. The optimized coated spiral reactor is then benchmarked to a conventional annular photoreactor of the same outer dimensions and total catalyst loading over a broad range of experimental conditions. Although residence time distribution experiments indicate slightly longer dwelling of molecules in the spiral reactor, no significant difference in by-passing of gas between the spiral reactor and the annular reactor can be claimed. Acetaldehyde degradation efficiency of 100% is obtained with the spiral reactor for a residence time as low as 60 s, whereas the annular reactor could not achieve full degradation even at 1000 s residence time. In a final case study, addition of long-term stable silver nanoparticles, protected by an ultra-thin polymer shell applied via the layer-by-layer (LbL) method, to the spiral reactor coating is shown to double the degradation efficiency and provides an interesting strategy to cope with higher pollutant concentrations without changing the overall dimensions.","312483","Embargo","-0.6153","0.3879","3","Walled carbon nanotubes, Case study, Additional data file","Walled carbon nanotubes, Case study, Additional data file","1",NA,NA,"",""

Another composition with the same Fe/Nb ratio but without boron was prepared in order to differentiate between the influence of B and Nb in the evolution of microstructure and magnetic properties. Amorphization of samples was followed by X-ray diffraction and Mössbauer spectroscopy, concluding that only B-containing alloys develop an amorphous phase, while for the B-free alloy a supersaturated solid solution was observed as the final microstructure. Nb is rapidly incorporated into the matrix whereas remaining B inclusions are found at the end of the explored milling range for all B-containing samples.

Such particles should possess a well-defined size with minimum agglomeration and they should be synthesized in a facile and reproducible high-yield way together with a controllable response to an applied static or dynamic field tailored for the specific application. Here, we attempt to enhance the heating efficiency in magnetic particle hyperthermia treatment through the proper adjustment of the core-shell morphology in ferrite particles, by controlling exchange and dipolar magnetic interactions at the nanoscale. Thus, core-shell nanoparticles with mutual coupling of magnetically hard (CoFe2O4) and soft (MnFe2O4) components are synthesized with facile synthetic controls resulting in uniform size and shell thickness as evidenced by high resolution transmission electron microscopy imaging, excellent crystallinity and size monodispersity. Such a magnetic coupling enables the fine tuning of magnetic anisotropy and magnetic interactions without sparing the good structural, chemical and colloidal stability. Consequently, the magnetic heating efficiency of CoFe2O4. and MnFe2O4 core-shell nanoparticles is distinctively different horn that of their counterparts, even though all these nanocrystals were synthesized under similar conditions. For better understanding of the AC magnetic hyperthermia response and its correlation with magnetic-origin features we study the effect of the volume ratio of magnetic hard and soft phases in the bimagnetic core-shell nanocrystals. Eventually, such particles may be considered as novel heating carriers that under further biomedical functionalization may become adaptable multifunctional heat-triggered nanoplatforms.

Through a case study with powder metallurgy fabricated 2.0 wt.% MWCNT/Al composites, the detectability limit of the proposed method is 0.4 wt.% Al4C3, corresponding to 5% extent of interfacial reaction with a measurement error of ± 3%. And then, with the already known MWCNT/Al reaction extent vs different sintering temperature and time, the reaction kinetics with an activation energy of 281 kJ mol− 1 was successfully derived.

Hereby we report a semiconductorionic heterostructure La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) and Sm-Ca co-doped ceria (SCDC) material possessing unique properties for new generation fuel cells using semiconductor-ionic heterostructure composite materials. The LSCF-SCDC system contains both ionic and electronic conductivities, above 0.1 S/cm, but used as the electrolyte for the fuel cell it has displayed promising performance in terms of OCV (above 1.0 V) and enhanced power density (ca. 1000 mW/cm(2) at 550 degrees C). Such high electronic conduction in the electrolyte membrane does not cause any short-circuiting problem in the device, instead delivering enhanced power output. Thus, the study of the charge separation/transport and electron blocking mechanism is crucial and can play a vital role in understanding the resulting physical properties and physics of the materials and device. With atomic level resolution ARM 200CF microscope equipped with the electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis, we can characterize more accurately the buried interface between the LSCF and SCDC further reveal the properties and distribution of charge carriers in the heterostructures. This phenomenon constrains the carrier mobility and determines the charge separation and devices' fundamental working mechanism; continued exploration of this frontier can fulfill a next generation fuel cell based on the new concept of semiconductor-ionic fuel cells (SIFCs).

By varying the deposition conditions, the film morphology and texture of the thin films are tuned and biaxial alignment is obtained. Studying the crystallographic and microstructural properties of the YSZ thin films, a tilted columnar growth was identified. This tilt is shown to be dependent on the compositional gradient of the sample. The variation of composition within a single YSZ column measured via STEM-EDX is demonstrated to be equal to the macroscopic variation on a full YSZ sample when deposited under the same deposition parameters. A simple stress model was developed to predict the tilt of the growing columns. The results indicate that this model not only determines the column bending of the growing film but also confirms that a macroscopic approach is sufficient to determine the compositional gradient in a single column of the YSZ thin films.

Here, we investigate the statistical behaviour of this method by applying it on a simulated data set with realistic noise levels. This phantom data set provides access to the true values contained in the data set as well as to many different realizations of the noise. Using least squares fitting and parameter estimation theory, we demonstrate that even though the precision on the estimated parameters can be better as the CramérRao lower bound, a significant bias is introduced which can alter the conclusions drawn from experimental data sets. The origin of this bias is in the incorrect retrieval of the principal loadings for noisy data. Using an expression for the bias and precision of the singular values from literature, we present an evaluation criterion for these singular values based on the noise level and the amount of information present in the data set. This criterion can help to judge when to avoid PCA noise filtering in practical situations. Further we show that constructing elemental maps of PCA noise filtered data using the background subtraction method, does not guarantee an increase in the signal to noise ratio due to correlation of the spectral data as a result of the filtering process.","312483","Open Access","0.5611","-0.5013","3","Walled carbon nanotubes, Case study, Additional data file","Walled carbon nanotubes, Case study, Additional data file","19",NA,NA,"",""

Since the resolution is related to the width of the point spread function of the microscope, it could in principle be determined from the image of a point object. However, in electron microscopy there are no ideal point objects. The smallest object is an individual atom. If the width of an atom is much smaller than the resolution of the microscope, this atom can still be considered as a point object. As the resolution of the microscope enters the sub-Å regime, information about the microscope is strongly entangled with the information about the atoms in HREM images. Therefore, we need to find an alternative method to determine the resolution in an object-independent way. In this work we propose to use the image wave of a crystalline object in zone axis orientation. Under this condition, the atoms of a column act as small lenses so that the electron beam channels through the atom column periodically. Because of this focusing, the image wave of the column can be much more peaked than the constituting atoms and can thus be a much more sensitive probe to measure the resolution. Our approach is to use the peakiness of the image wave of the atom column to determine the resolution. We will show that the resolution can be directly linked to the total curvature of the atom column wave. Moreover, we can then directly obtain the resolution of the microscope given that the contribution from the object is known, which is related to the bounding energy of the atom. The method is applied on an experimental CaTiO3 image wave.","312483","Open Access","-0.3249","-0.6045","5","Resolution electron tomography, Haadf stem, Reconstruction technique","Resolution electron tomography, Haadf stem, Reconstruction technique","0",NA,NA,"",""

For this purpose, an efficient algorithm is proposed for the estimation of atomic column positions and intensities from high angle annular dark field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images. Furthermore, the so-called CramérRao lower bound (CRLB) is reviewed to determine the limits to the precision with which continuous parameters such as atomic column positions and intensities can be estimated. Since this lower bound can only be derived for continuous parameters, alternative measures using the principles of detection theory are introduced for problems concerning the estimation of discrete parameters such as atomic numbers. An experimental case study is presented to show the practical use of these measures for the optimization of the experiment design if the purpose is to decide between the presence of specific atom types using STEM images.","312483","Closed Access","-0.4171","-0.4524","12","Transmission electron microscopy, Scanning transmission electron, Annular dark field","Transmission electron microscopy, Scanning transmission electron, Annular dark field","23",NA,NA,"",""

However, at atomic resolution the image of a single atom extends over many such slices and incorporating this image as prior knowledge in tomography or depth sectioning therefore requires a fully three-dimensional treatment. Unfortunately, the size of the three-dimensional projection operator scales highly unfavorably with object size and readily exceeds the available computer memory. In this paper, it is shown that for incoherent image formation the memory requirement can be reduced to the fundamental lower limit of the object size, both for tomography and depth sectioning. Furthermore, it is shown through multislice calculations that high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy can be sufficiently incoherent for the reconstruction of single element nanocrystals, but that dynamical diffraction effects can cause classification problems if more than one element is present.

Energy resolution has also been increasing steadily with the continuous improvement of electron monochromators. Electronic excitations however are known to be delocalized due to the long range interaction of the charged accelerated electrons with the electrons in a sample. This has made several scientists question the value of combined high spatial and energy resolution for mapping interband transitions and possibly phonon excitation in crystals. In this paper we demonstrate experimentally that atomic resolution information is indeed available at very low energy losses around 100 meV expressed as a modulation of the broadening of the zero loss peak. Careful data analysis allows us to get a glimpse of what are likely phonon excitations with both an energy loss and gain part. These experiments confirm recent theoretical predictions on the strong localization of phonon excitations as opposed to electronic excitations and show that a combination of atomic resolution and recent developments in increased energy resolution will offer great benefit for mapping phonon modes in real space.","246791","Open Access","-0.0095","-0.3941","5","Resolution electron tomography, Haadf stem, Reconstruction technique","Resolution electron tomography, Haadf stem, Reconstruction technique","8",NA,NA,"",""

The identification of compositional fluctuations or verification of random-alloy distribution is hence of grave importance. Here, a comprehensive multiprobe study of composition and compositional homogeneity is presented, investigating AlInGaN layers with indium concentrations ranging from 0 to 17 at% and aluminium concentrations between 0 and 39 at% employing high-angle annular dark field scanning electron microscopy (HAADF STEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and atom probe tomography (APT). EDX mappings reveal distributions of local concentrations which are in good agreement with random alloy atomic distributions. This was hence investigated with HAADF STEM by comparison with theoretical random alloy expectations using statistical tests. To validate the performance of these tests, HAADF STEM image simulations were carried out for the case of a random-alloy distribution of atoms and for the case of In-rich clusters with nanometer dimensions. The investigated samples, which were grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE), were thereby found to be homogeneous on this nanometer scale. Analysis of reconstructions obtained from APT measurements yielded matching results.

This comparison merely requires the experimental data to be normalised and expressed in units of fractional beam-current. However, inhomogeneities in the response of electron detectors can complicate this normalisation. The quantification procedure becomes both experiment and instrument specific, requiring new simulations for the particular response of each instrument's detector, and for every camera-length used. This not only impedes the comparison between different instruments and research groups, but can also be computationally very time consuming. Furthermore, not all image simulation methods allow for the inclusion of an inhomogeneous detector response. In this work, we propose an alternative method for normalising experimental data in order to compare these with simulations that consider a homogeneous detector response. To achieve this, we determine the electron flux distribution reaching the detector by means of a camera-length series or a so-called atomic column cross-section averaged convergent beam electron diffraction (XSACBED) pattern. The result is then used to determine the relative weighting of the detector response. Here we show that the results obtained by this new electron flux weighted (EFW) method are comparable to the currently used method, while considerably simplifying the needed simulation libraries. The proposed method also allows one to obtain a metric that describes the quality of the detector response in comparison with the ideal detector response.","312483","Open Access","-0.0981","-0.6","9","Electron energy loss, Condensed matter::materials science, Energy loss spectroscopy","Electron energy loss, Condensed matter::materials science, Energy loss spectroscopy","14",NA,NA,"",""

Here, atomically resolved images of nanomaterials are acquired, where the contrast depends on the illumination, imaging and detector conditions of the microscope. Visualization of light elements is possible when using low angle annular dark field (LAADF) STEM, annular bright field (ABF) STEM, integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC) STEM, negative spherical aberration imaging (NCSI) and imaging STEM (ISTEM). In this work, images of a NdGaO3-La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (NGO-LSMO) interface are quantitatively evaluated by using statistical parameter estimation theory. For imaging light elements, all techniques are providing reliable results, while the techniques based on interference contrast, NCSI and ISTEM, are less robust in terms of accuracy for extracting heavy column locations. In term of precision, sample drift and scan distortions mainly limits the STEM based techniques as compared to NCSI. Post processing techniques can, however, partially compensate for this. In order to provide an outlook to the future, simulated images of NGO, in which the unavoidable presence of Poisson noise is taken into account, are used to determine the ultimate precision. In this future counting noise limited scenario, NCSI and ISTEM imaging will provide more precise values as compared to the other techniques, which can be related to the mechanisms behind the image recording.","280432","Embargo","-0.3777","-0.5232","12","Transmission electron microscopy, Scanning transmission electron, Annular dark field","Transmission electron microscopy, Scanning transmission electron, Annular dark field","1",NA,NA,"",""

Such high H-2 production performance can be attributed to both the phase-juncted Pt/PtO providing more active sites while PtO suppresses the undesirable hydrogen back reaction, and the special hierarchically porous TiO2 network with inner-particle mesopores presenting short diffusion path lengths for photogenerated electrons and enhanced light harvesting efficiency.

This nanostructured catalyst depicts not only high oxygen storage capacity (OSC) values but, more importantly, an outstandingly stable redox response upon oxidation and reduction treatments at very high temperatures, above 1000 degrees C. This behavior largely improves that observed on conventional ceria-zirconia solid solutions, not only of the same composition but also of those with much higher molar cerium contents. Advanced scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM-XEDS) studies have revealed as key not only to detect the actual state of the lanthanide in this novel nanocatalyst but also to rationalize its unusual resistance to redox deactivation at very high temperatures. In particular, high-resolution X-ray dispersive energy studies have revealed the presence of unique bilayer ceria islands on top of the surface of YSZ nanocrystals, which remain at surface positions upon oxidation and reduction treatments up to 1000 degrees C. Diffusion of ceria into the bulk of these crystallites upon oxidation at 1100 degrees C irreversibly deteriorates both the reducibility and OSC of this nanostructured catalyst.","335078","Embargo","-0.3561","0.3558","14","Periodic mesoporous, Ii bis oxazoline, Copper ii bis","Periodic mesoporous, Ii bis oxazoline, Copper ii bis","0",NA,NA,"",""

The compound contains puckered FeSeO layers composed of FeSe2O2 tetrahedra sharing all their vertexes. Two polymorphs coexist that can be derived from an archetype BaZnSO structure by cooperative tilting of the FeSe2O2 tetrahedra. The polymorphs differ in the relative arrangement of the puckered layers of vertex-linked FeSe2O2 tetrahedra. In a noncentrosymmetric Cmc21 polymorph (a = 3.89684(2) Å, b = 13.22054(8) Å, c = 5.93625(2) Å) the layers are related by the C-centering translation, while in a centrosymmetric Pmcn polymorph, with a similar cell metric (a = 3.89557(6) Å, b = 13.2237(6) Å, c = 5.9363(3) Å), the layers are related by inversion. The compound shows long-range antiferromagnetic order below a Neél temperature of 159(1) K with both polymorphs showing antiferromagnetic coupling via FeOFe linkages and ferromagnetic coupling via FeSeFe linkages within the FeSeO layers. The magnetic susceptibility also shows evidence for weak ferromagnetism which is modeled in the refinements of the magnetic structure as arising from an uncompensated spin canting in the noncentrosymmetric polymorph. There is also a spin glass component to the magnetism which likely arises from the disordered regions of the structure evident in the transmission electron microscopy.","312483","Closed Access","0.2706","0.4966","1","Article, Interferometric methods, Magnetic properties","Article, Interferometric methods, Magnetic properties","2","11","1","",""

C, Nanomaterials and Interfaces","","Formation of uniform Fe and SrO rods as well as nanoparticles following controlled reduction of La0.6Sr0.4FeO3−δ (LSF) and Ni-LSF samples in dry and moist hydrogen is studied by aberration-corrected electron microscopy. Metallic Fe and SrO precipitate from the perovskite lattice as rods of several tenths of nm and thicknesses up to 20 nm. Based on a model of Fe whisker growth following reduction of pure iron oxides, Fe rod exsolution from LSF proceeds via rate-limiting lattice oxygen removal. This favors the formation of single iron metal nuclei at the perovskite surface, subsequently growing as isolated rods. The latter is only possible upon efficient removal of reduction-induced water and, subsequently, reduction of Fe +III/+IV to Fe(0). If water remains in the system, no reduction or rod formation occurs. In contrast, formation of SrO rods following reduction in dry hydrogen is a catalytic process aided by Ni particles. It bears significant resemblance to surface diffusion-controlled carbon whisker growth on Ni, leading to similar extrusion rods and filaments. In addition to SrO rod growth, the exsolution of Fe nanoparticles and, subsequently, Ni–Fe alloy particles is observed. The latter have also been observed under static hydrogen reduction. Under strict control of the experimental parameters, the presented data therefore open an attractive chemically driven pathway to metal nanoarchitectures beyond the formation of “simple” nanoparticles.","312483","Open Access","-0.0906","0.6838","3","Walled carbon nanotubes, Case study, Additional data file","Walled carbon nanotubes, Case study, Additional data file","8",NA,NA,"",""

C, Nanomaterials and Interfaces","","Catalytic and optical properties can be coupled by combining different metals into nanoscale architectures where both the shape and composition provide fine-tuning of functionality. Here, discrete, small Pt nanoparticles (diameter = 3 - 6 nm) were grown in linear arrays on Au nanoprisms, and the resulting structures are shown to retain strong localized surface plasmon resonances. Multi-dimensional electron microscopy and spectroscopy techniques (energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electron tomography and electron energy-loss spectroscopy) were used to unravel their local composition, 3D morphology, growth patterns, and optical properties. The composition and tomographic analyses disclose otherwise ambiguous details of the Pt-decorated Au nanoprisms, revealing that both pseudospherical protrusions and dendritic Pt nanoparticles grow on all faces of the nanoprisms (the faceted or occasionally twisted morphologies of which are also revealed), and shed light on the alignment of Pt nanoparticles. The electron energy-loss spectroscopy investigations show that the Au nanoprisms sustain multiple localized surface plasmon resonances despite the presence of pendant Pt nanoparticles. The plasmonic fields at the surface of the nanoprisms indeed extend into the Pt nanoparticles, opening possibilities for combined optical and catalytic applications. These insights pave the way towards comprehensive nano-engineering of multi-functional bimetallic nanostructures, with potential application in plasmon-enhanced catalysis and in-situ monitoring of chemical processes via surface-enhanced spectroscopy.

These high photoluminescence efficiencies make these crystals ideal candidates for light-emitting diodes (LEDs). However, because of the large surface area to volume ratio, halogen exchange between perovskite nanocrystals of different compositions occurs rapidly, which is one of the limiting factors for white-light applications requiring a mixture of different crystal compositions to achieve a broad emission spectrum. Here, we use mixtures of chloride and iodide CsPbX3 (X = Cl, I) perovskite nanocrystals where anion exchange is significantly reduced. We investigate samples containing mixtures of perovskite nanocrystals with different compositions and study the resulting optical and electrical interactions.

Advanced transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques (image-corrected high-resolution TEM with exit wave reconstruction and probe-corrected high-angle annular dark field-scanning TEM) unequivocally indicate that the triangular base of the pyramids is the polar (000 (1) over bar) facet and their apex points toward the [0001] direction. Density functional theory calculations, based on a simple model of binding of Cl- ions to surface Cd atoms, support the experimentally evident higher thermodynamic stability of the (000 (1) over bar) facet over the (0001) one conferred by Cl- ions. The relative stability of the two polar facets of wurtzite CdSe is reversed compared to previous experimental and computational studies on Cd chalcogenide NCs, in which no Cl-based chemicals were deliberately used in the synthesis or no Cl- ions were considered in the binding models. Self-assembly of these pyramids in a peculiar clover-like geometry, triggered by the addition of oleic acid, suggests that the basal (polar) facet has a density and perhaps type of ligands significantly different from the other three facets, since the pyramids interact with each other exclusively via their lateral facets. A superstructure, however with no long-range order, is observed for clovers with their (000 (1) over bar) facets roughly facing each other. The CdSe pyramids were also exploited as seeds for CdS pods growth, and the peculiar shape of the derived branched nanostructures clearly arises from the inverted polarity of the seeds.","312483","Open Access","-0.7067","-0.0056","3","Walled carbon nanotubes, Case study, Additional data file","Walled carbon nanotubes, Case study, Additional data file","6","31","2","",""

Starting with ∼210 nm × 32 nm gold cores, we produce nanowire lengths up to several microns in a highly controlled manner, with a small self-limited increase in thickness of ∼4 nm, corresponding to aspect ratios above 100, whereas the low polydispersity of the product allows us to detect up to nine distinguishable plasmonic resonances in a single colloidal solution.

However, when blended together, these materials have also raised novel fundamental questions with respect to electronic, optical, and thermodynamic properties. This is particularly important for organic photovoltaic cells based on the bulk heterojunction. Here, the distribution of nanoscale domains plays a crucial role depending on the specific device structure. Hence, correlation of the aforementioned properties requires 3D nanoscale imaging of materials domains, which are embedded in a multilayer device. Such visualization has so far been elusive due to lack of contrast, insufficient signal, or resolution limits. In this Letter, we introduce spectral scanning transmission electron tomography for reconstruction of entire volume plasmon spectra from rod-shaped specimens. We provide 3D structural correlations and compositional mapping at a resolution of approximately 7 nm within advanced organic photovoltaic tandem cells. Novel insights that are obtained from quantitative 3D analyses reveal that efficiency loss upon thermal annealing can be attributed to subtle, fundamental blend properties. These results are invaluable in guiding the design and optimization of future devices in plastic electronics applications and provide an empirical basis for modeling and simulation of organic solar cells.","287594","Open Access","-0.1146","-0.1038","9","Electron energy loss, Condensed matter::materials science, Energy loss spectroscopy","Electron energy loss, Condensed matter::materials science, Energy loss spectroscopy","18",NA,NA,"",""

Coherent twin planes confined to the (NaMnO2) layers, parallel to the (10 (1) over bar) crystallographic planes of the monoclinic layered rock-salt-type alpha-NaMnO2 (O3) structure, form quasi-periodic modulated sequences, with the known alpha-and beta-NaMnO2 polymorphs as the two limiting cases. The energy difference between the polymorphic forms, estimated using a DFT-based structure relaxation, is on the scale of the typical thermal energies that results in a high degree of stacking disorder in these compounds. The results unveil the remarkable effect of the twin planes on both the magnetic and electrochemical properties. The polymorphism drives the magnetic ground state from a quasi-1D spin system for the geometrically frustrated alpha-polymorph through a two-leg spin ladder for the intermediate stacking sequence toward a quasi-2D magnet for the beta-polymorph. A substantial increase of the equilibrium potential for Na deintercalation upon increasing the concentration of the twin planes is calculated, providing a possibility to tune the electrochemical potential of the layered rock-salt ABO(2) cathodes by engineering the materials with a controlled concentration of twins.","312483","Closed Access","0.2252","0.3046","1","Article, Interferometric methods, Magnetic properties","Article, Interferometric methods, Magnetic properties","16",NA,NA,"",""

Solution-based bottom-up methods are emerging as promising routes to produce free-standing NSs, but the synthesis of colloidal NSs with well-defined size and shape has remained a major challenge. In this work, we report a novel method that yields 2 nm thick colloidal Cu2-xS NSs with well-defined shape (triangular or hexagonal) and size (100 nm to 3 mu m). The key feature of our approach is the use of a synergistic interaction between halides (Br or Cl) and copper-thiolate metal-organic frameworks to create a template that imposes 2D constraints on the Cu-catalyzed C-S thermolysis, resulting in nucleation and growth of colloidal 2D Cu2-xS NSs. Moreover, the NS composition can be postsynthetically tailored by exploiting topotactic cation exchange reactions. This is illustrated by converting the Cu2-xS NSs into ZnS and CdS NSs while preserving their size and shape. The method presented here thus holds great promise as a route to solution-processable compositionally diverse ultrathin colloidal NSs with well-defined shape and size.","312483","Open Access","0.09","0.7554","3","Walled carbon nanotubes, Case study, Additional data file","Walled carbon nanotubes, Case study, Additional data file","32",NA,NA,"",""

To date, however, there remain challenges in reliably achieving these goals of orientation-controlled nanowire synthesis and assembly. Here we report that growth of planar, vertical and randomly oriented tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) nanowires can be realized on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrates via the epitaxy-assisted vaporliquidsolid (VLS) mechanism, by simply regulating the growth conditions, in particular the growth temperature. This robust control on nanowire orientation is facilitated by the small lattice mismatch of 1.6% between ITO and YSZ. Further control of the orientation, symmetry and shape of the nanowires can be achieved by using YSZ substrates with (110) and (111), in addition to (100) surfaces. Based on these insights, we succeed in growing regular arrays of planar ITO nanowires from patterned catalyst nanoparticles. Overall, our discovery of unprecedented orientation control in ITO nanowires advances the general VLS synthesis, providing a robust epitaxy-based approach toward rational synthesis of nanowires.","312483","Open Access","0.2662","0.6596","2","Aberration corrected, Algan nanowires, Alloy composition","Aberration corrected, Algan nanowires, Alloy composition","24","19","1","",""

Thin film oxides are particularly apt for strain engineering new functionalities in ferroic materials. In the case of La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 (LCMO) thin films, here we show the first experimental images obtained by electron holography demonstrating that epitaxial strain induces the segregation of a flat and uniform nonferromagnetic layer with antiferromagnetic (AFM) character at the top surface of a ferromagnetic (FM) layer, the whole film being chemical and structurally homogeneous at room temperature. For different substrates and growth conditions the tetragonality of LCMO at room temperature, defined as τ = |c – a|/a, is the driving force for a phase coexistence above an approximate critical value of τC ≈ 0.024. Theoretical calculations prove that the increased tetragonality changes the energy balance of the FM and AFM ground states in strained LCMO, enabling the formation of magnetically inhomogeneous states.

However, the direct growth of a conformal noble metal shell on magnetic metals is a challenge.

Here we investigate a recently discovered Fe4O5 that adopts an orthorhombic CaFe3O5-type crystal structure that features linear chains of Fe ions. On cooling below similar to 150 K, Fe4O5 undergoes an unusual charge-ordering transition that involves competing dimeric and trimeric ordering within the chains of Fe ions. This transition is concurrent with a significant increase in electrical resistivity.

In particular, we analyse diffuse scattering in transmission electron microscopy, to show that small molecules that have their side chains attached along the long axis of their conjugated core are better encapsulated in their crystal structure, which helps reduce large-amplitude thermal motions. Our work provides a general strategy for the design of new classes of very high mobility organic semiconductors with a low degree of dynamic disorder.

These 2DEGs at complex oxide interfaces involve many-body interactions and give rise to a rich set of phenomena5, for example, superconductivity6, magnetism7,8, tunable metal-insulator transitions9, and phase separation10.

We find that the electron mobility of the interfacial 2DEG is enhanced by more than two orders of magnitude. Our in-situ and resonant x-ray spectroscopic in addition to transmission electron microscopy results indicate that the manganite layer undergoes unambiguous electronic reconstruction and leads to modulation doping of such atomically engineered complex oxide heterointerfaces. At low temperatures, the modulation-doped 2DEG exhibits clear Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and the initial manifestation of the quantum Hall effect, demonstrating an unprecedented high-mobility and low electron density oxide 2DEG system.

The strong oxygen octahedral coupling is found to transfer the octahedral rotation, present in the NdGaO3 (NGO) substrate, to the La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (LSMO) film in the interface region. This causes an unexpected realignment of the magnetic easy axis along the short axis of the LSMO unit cell as well as the presence of a giant anisotropic transport in these ultrathin LSMO films. As a result we possess control of the lateral magnetic and electronic anisotropies by atomic-scale design of the oxygen octahedral rotation.","246102","Open Access","0.4563","0.3322","1","Article, Interferometric methods, Magnetic properties","Article, Interferometric methods, Magnetic properties","64","118","8","",""

So far, no true magnetic monopoles were found experimentally. Using the Aharonov-Bohm effect, one of the central results of quantum physics, shows however, that an effective monopole field can be produced. Understanding the effects of such a monopole field on its surroundings is crucial to its observation and provides a better grasp of fundamental physical theory. We realize the diffraction of fast electrons at a magnetic monopole field generated by a nanoscopic magnetized ferromagnetic needle. Previous studies have been limited to theoretical semiclassical optical calculations of the motion of electrons in such a monopole field. Solid state systems like the recently studied 'spin ice' provide a constrained system to study similar fields, but make it impossible to separate the monopole from the material. Free space diffraction helps to understand the dynamics of the electron-monopole system without the complexity of a solid state system. The use of a simple object such as a magnetized needle will allow various areas of physics to use the general dynamical effects of monopole fields without requiring a monopole particle or specific solids which have internal monopole-like properties. The experiment performed here shows that even without a true magnetic monopole particle, the theoretical background on monopoles serves as a basis for experiments and can be applied to efficiently create electron vortices. Various predictions about angular momentum and general field effects can readily be studied using the available equipment. This realization provides insights for the scientific community on how to detect magnetic monopoles in high energy collisions, cosmological processes, or novel materials.","278510","Open Access","0.3194","0.0479","1","Article, Interferometric methods, Magnetic properties","Article, Interferometric methods, Magnetic properties","62","88","4","",""

			The breaking of time reversal symmetry (TRS) in three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators (TIs), and thus the opening of a 'Dirac-mass gap' in the linearly dispersed Dirac surface state, is a prerequisite for unlocking exotic physical states. Introducing ferromagnetic long-range order by transition metal doping has been shown to break TRS. Here, we present the study of lanthanide (Ln) doped Bi2Te3, where the magnetic doping with high-moment lanthanides promises large energy gaps. Using molecular beam epitaxy, single-crystalline, rhombohedral thin films with Ln concentrations of up to ∼35%, substituting on Bi sites, were achieved for Dy, Gd, and Ho doping. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy shows the characteristic Dirac cone for Gd and Ho doping. In contrast, for Dy doping above a critical doping concentration, a gap opening is observed via the decreased spectral intensity at the Dirac point, indicating a topological quantum phase transition persisting up to room-temperature.

For the proof of principle, organosoluble trimethylsilyl-cellulose (TMSC) thin films have been deposited by spin coating on SiO2 / Si and exposed to a nano-sized electron beam. It turns out that in the exposed areas an electron induced desilylation reaction takes place converting soluble TMSC to rather insoluble cellulose. After removal of the unexposed TMSC areas, structured cellulose patterns remain on the surface with FWHM line widths down to 70?nm. Systematic FEBIC parameter sweeps reveal a generally electron dose dependent behavior with three working regimes: incomplete conversion, ideal doses and over exposure. Direct (FT-IR) and indirect chemical analyses (enzymatic degradation) confirmed the cellulosic character of ideally converted areas. These investigations are complemented by a theoretical model which suggests a two-step reaction process by means of TMSC???cellulose and cellulose???non-cellulose material conversion in excellent agreement with experimental data.

However, the magnetism of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 is strongly modified near interfaces, which was addressed as ?dead-layer? phenomenon whose origin is still controversial. Here, both magnetic and structural properties of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures were investigated, with emphasis on the quantitative analysis of oxygen octahedral rotation (OOR) across interfaces using annular-bright-field imaging. OOR was found to be significantly altered near interface for both La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 and SrTiO3, as linked to the magnetism deterioration.

R.","2017-02-01","Nature Publishing Group","publication","","Scientific Reports","","Abstract: Nano-sized gold has become an important material in various fields of science and technology, where control over the size and crystallography is desired to tailor the functionality. Gold crystallizes in the face-centered cubic (fcc) phase, and its hexagonal closed packed (hcp) structure is a very unusual and rare phase. Stable Au hcp phase has been reported to form in nanoparticles at the tips of some Ge nanowires. It has also recently been synthesized in the form of thin graphene-supported sheets which are unstable under electron beam irradiation. Here, we show that stable hcp Au 3D nanostructures with well-defined crystallographic orientation and size can be systematically created in a process of thermally induced self-assembly of thin Au layer on Ge(001) monocrystal. The Au hcp crystallite is present in each Au nanostructure and has been characterized by different electron microscopy techniques. We report that a careful heat treatment above the eutectic melting temperature and a controlled cooling is required to form the hcp phase of Au on a Ge single crystal. This new method gives scientific prospects to obtain stable Au hcp phase for future applications in a rather simple manner as well as redefine the phase diagram of Gold with Germanium.","312483","Open Access","0.3881","-0.0033","7","Bifeo revealed, Domain walls, Magnetic domain wall","Bifeo revealed, Domain walls, Magnetic domain wall","3",NA,NA,"",""

Our cell has a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.2% under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) and an internal quantum efficiency of close to 100%, which means that nearly all the absorbed photons are converted to electrons and are efficiently collected at the electrodes. This implies that the exciton diffusion, charge transfer and charge collection are highly efficient. The high exciton diffusion efficiency is enabled by the long diffusion length of CH3NH3PbI3 relative to its thickness. Furthermore, the low exciton binding energy of CH3NH3PbI3 implies that exciton splitting at the CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM interface is very efficient. With further increase in CH3NH3PbI3 thickness, a higher PCE of 7.4% could be obtained.

Despite its commercial implementation, we still lack fundamental insights into the various deactivation processes taking place during FTS. In this work, a combination of three methods for studying single catalyst particles at different length scales has been developed and applied to study the deactivation of Co/TiO2 Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) catalysts. By combining transmission X-ray microscopy (TXM), scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy-electron energy loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) we visualized changes in the structure, aggregate size and distribution of supported Co nanoparticles that occur during FTS. At the microscale, Co nanoparticle aggregates are transported over several μm leading to a more homogeneous Co distribution, while at the nanoscale Co forms a thin layer of ∼1–2 nm around the TiO2 support. The formation of the Co layer is the opposite case to the “classical” strong metal–support interaction (SMSI) in which TiO2 surrounds the Co, and is possibly related to the surface oxidation of Co metal nanoparticles in combination with coke formation. In other words, the observed migration and formation of a thin CoOx layer are similar to a previously discussed reaction-induced spreading of metal oxides across a TiO2 surface.","312483","Open Access","-0.2553","0.2768","3","Walled carbon nanotubes, Case study, Additional data file","Walled carbon nanotubes, Case study, Additional data file","10","42","3","",""

BiVO4 nanoparticles and 3DOM TiO2 inverse opal were fabricated respectively. These materials were characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, N-2 adsorption-desorption and UV-vis diffuse (UV-vis) and photoluminescence spectroscopies. As references for comparison, a physical mixture of BiVO4 nanoparticles and 3DOM TiO2 inverse opal powder (0.08 : 1), and a BiVO4/P25 TiO2 (0.08 : 1) nanocomposite made also by the hydrothermal method were prepared. The photocatalytic performance of all the prepared materials was evaluated by the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) as a model pollutant molecule under visible light irradiation. The highly ordered 3D macroporous inverse opal structure can provide more active surface areas and increased mass transfer because of its highly accessible 3D porosity. The results show that 3DOM BiVO4/TiO2 nanocomposites possess a highly prolonged lifetime and increased separation of visible light generated charges and extraordinarily high photocatalytic activity. Owing to the intimate contact between BiVO4 and large surface area 3DOM TiO2, the photogenerated high energy charges can be easily transferred from BiVO4 to the 3DOM TiO2 support. BiVO4 nanoparticles in the 3DOM TiO2 inverse opal structure act thus as a sensitizer to absorb visible light and to transfer efficiently high energy electrons to TiO2 to ensure long lifetime of the photogenerated charges and keep them well separated, owing to the direct bandgap of BiVO4 of 2.4 eV, favourably positioned band edges, very low recombination rate of electron-hole pairs and stability when coupled with photocatalysts, explaining the extraordinarily high photocatalytic performance of 3DOM BiVO4/TiO2 nanocomposites. It is found that larger the amount of BiVO4 in the nanocomposite, longer the duration of photogenerated charge separation and higher the photocatalytic activity.

A newly developed alternative circumvents this by counting the number of atoms across a single projection. These atom counts can be used to create an initial atomic model with which an energy minimization can be applied to obtain a relaxed 3D reconstruction of the nanoparticle. Here, we compare, at the atomic scale, this single projection reconstruction approach with tomography and find an excellent agreement.

D.","2017-05-01","Royal Society of Chemistry","publication","","Chemical Science","","Owing to their great significance for energy storage and sensing applications, multi-layer papers consisting of graphene oxide–carbon nanotube (GO–CNT) hybrid sheets were prepared by in situ exfoliation of graphite oxide in the presence of oxidized CNTs (oCNTs). For the first time we elucidate the influence of oCNTs on chemisorbed water (CW), i.e. the water molecules inherently bound to the oxygen functional groups (OFGs) of graphene oxide (GO) and responsible for irreversible structural damage upon thermal reduction processes. We show that oCNTs self-assemble onto GO sheets during the liquid phase processing steps by forming cooperatively strengthened OH···O C hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic groups of the oCNTs and OFGs of GO. At oCNT amounts of about 10 to 15 wt% this leads to the displacement of considerable amounts of CW without altering the original chemical composition of GO. The thermally reduced GO–CNT (rGO–CNT) papers reveal improved sp2 character and an enhancement of the specific capacitance by 75% with respect to thermally reduced GO (rGO), largely due to the effective removal of CW by oxidized CNTs. These findings disclose the relevance of the cooperative hydrogen bonding phenomena in graphene oxide paper/film electrodes for the development of improved electrochemical energy storage and sensing devices.","312483","Open Access","0.4374","0.6545","3","Walled carbon nanotubes, Case study, Additional data file","Walled carbon nanotubes, Case study, Additional data file","1",NA,NA,"",""

X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveal the RP structure with n = 2-4 in accordance with the growth recipe. RP defects, observed by TEM in a good correlation with the in-situ ellipsometry, mainly result from the excess of SrO.

YBa2Cu3O7−δ (YBCO) superconducting thin films containing nanosized BaHfO3 (BHO) particles yield a significant improvement of the magnetic flux pinning properties and a reduced anisotropy of the critical current density. These films were prepared by chemical solution deposition (CSD) on (100) SrTiO3 (STO) substrates yielding critical current densities up to 3.6 MA cm−2 at 77 K and self-field. Transport in-field J c measurements demonstrated a high pinning force maximum of around 6 GN/m3 for a sample annealed at T = 760 °C that has a doping of 12 mol% of BHO. This sample was investigated by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) in combination with electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) yielding strain and spectral maps. Spherical BHO nanoparticles of 15 nm in size were found in the matrix, whereas the particles at the interface were flat. A 2 nm diffusion layer containing Ti was found at the YBCO (BHO)/STO interface. Local lattice deformation mapping at the atomic scale revealed crystal defects induced by the presence of both sorts of BHO nanoparticles, which can act as pinning centers for magnetic flux lines. Two types of local lattice defects were identified and imaged: (i) misfit edge dislocations and (ii) Ba-Cu-Cu-Ba stacking faults (Y-248 intergrowths). The local electronic structure and charge transfer were probed by high energy resolution monochromated electron energy-loss spectroscopy. This technique made it possible to distinguish superconducting from non-superconducting areas in nanocomposite samples with atomic resolution in real space, allowing the identification of local pinning sites on the order of the coherence length of YBCO (~1.5 nm) and the determination of 0.25 nm dislocation cores.","246791","Closed Access","0.0031","-0.0214","9","Electron energy loss, Condensed matter::materials science, Energy loss spectroscopy","Electron energy loss, Condensed matter::materials science, Energy loss spectroscopy","3",NA,NA,"",""

At remanence, defocused LM images showed the periodicity dependence of the magnetic states inside the lattice. A remarkable transition was observed in the type of domain structures as a function of p: for the large periodicities (p > 300 nm), conventional 90° and 180° domain walls were formed, whereas in small-period antidot arrays (p lE 160 nm) magnetic superdomain walls (SDWs) were nucleated to separate regions with different average magnetization direction, the so-called magnetic superdomains. In the SDW regime, a low-frequency Fourier filtering method was implemented to allow a quantitative analysis of the LM images by the transport of intensity equation method. In situ LM experiments under applied magnetic fields were performed to study the reversal magnetization process in a particular array (p = 160 nm), and clear differences were observed as a function of the magnetic field orientation. The switching process under magnetic fields parallel to the horizontal antidot rows occurs in two stages: the system first nucleates and propagates horizontal SDWs, parallel to the field. Then, at higher magnetic fields, vertical SDWs, perpendicular to the field, appear before saturation. When the magnetic field is applied at 45° with respect to the antidot rows, both horizontal and vertical SDWs are nucleated and propagated simultaneously. All the experiments were successfully correlated with micromagnetic simulations. The current study sheds new light on the magnetization reversal processes of antidot arrays and opens new possibilities of exploiting the potential of high-resolution in situ LM and new data analysis procedures to probe magnetization processes in nanomagnetism, particularly in periodic arrays of nanomagnets.","312483","Closed Access","0.4779","0.277","1","Article, Interferometric methods, Magnetic properties","Article, Interferometric methods, Magnetic properties","6",NA,NA,"",""

We employed a new, simple, cost-effective pyrolytic method to synthetize oxidized-graphenic nanoplatelets (OGNP) using bamboo pyroligneous acid (BPA) as a source. Thorough analyses via high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy provides a complete structural and chemical description at the local scale of these samples. In particular, we found that at the highest carbonization temperature the OGNP-BPA are mainly in a sp bonding configuration (sp fraction of 87%). To determine the electrical properties of single nanoplatelets, these were contacted by Pt nanowires deposited through focused-ion-beam-induced deposition techniques. Increased conductivity by two orders of magnitude is observed as oxygen content decreases from 17% to 5%, reaching a value of 2.3 10 S m at the lowest oxygen content. Temperature-dependent conductivity reveals a semiconductor transport behavior, described by the Mott three-dimensional variable range hopping mechanism. From the localization length, we estimate a band-gap value of 0.22(2) eV for an oxygen content of 5%. This investigation demonstrates the great potential of the OGNP-BPA for technological applications, given that their structural and electrical behavior is similar to the highly reduced rGO sheets obtained by more sophisticated conventional synthesis methods.","312483","Closed Access","-0.2555","0.1683","9","Electron energy loss, Condensed matter::materials science, Energy loss spectroscopy","Electron energy loss, Condensed matter::materials science, Energy loss spectroscopy","6","7","2","",""

Beams with a well-defined OAM, the so-called vortex beams, are applied already in, e.g., telecommunication, astrophysics, nanomanipulation, and chiral measurements in optics and electron microscopy. Also, the OAM of a wave induced by the interaction with a sample has attracted a lot of interest. In all these experiments it is crucial to measure the exact (local) OAM content of the wave, whether it is an incoming vortex beam or an exit wave after interacting with a sample. In this work we investigate the use of spiral phase plates (SPPs) as an alternative to the programmable phase plates used in optics to measure OAM. We derive analytically how these can be used to study the local OAM components of any wave function. By means of numerical simulations we illustrate how the OAM of a pure vortex beam can be measured. We also look at a sum of misaligned vortex beams and show how, by using SPPs, the position and the OAM of each individual beam can be detected. Finally, we look at the OAM induced by a magnetic dipole on a free-electron wave and show how the SPP can be used to localize the magnetic poles and measure their \"magnetic charge.\" Although our findings can be applied to study the OAM of any wave function, our findings are of particular interest for electron microscopy where versatile programmable phase plates do not yet exist.","312483","Open Access","0.4251","-0.4168","7","Bifeo revealed, Domain walls, Magnetic domain wall","Bifeo revealed, Domain walls, Magnetic domain wall","6",NA,NA,"",""

In the limit of large collection angles, we analytically calculate that the average of a pair of $\ell=\pm1$ SPP images is directly proportional to the gradient squared of the exit wave, explaining the edge contrast previously seen in optical SPP work. The difference between a clockwise-anticlockwise pair of SPP images and conditions where this difference vanishes and the gradient of the exit wave can be seen from one single SPP image, are discussed. Finally, we demonstrate how with three images, one without and one with each of an $\ell=\pm1$ SPP, may give enough information to reconstruct both the amplitude and the phase of the exit wave.

As a consequence of this, elastic scattering of plane-wave photons or electrons within the first-order Born-approximation, as well as Fraunhofer diffraction on any aperture, is bound to result in centrosymmetric diffraction patterns. Friedel's law, however, does not apply for vortex beams, and centrosymmetry in general is not present in their diffraction patterns. In this work we extend Friedel's law for vortex beams by showing that the diffraction patterns of vortex beams with opposite topological charge, scattered on the same two-dimensional potential, always are centrosymmetric to one another, regardless of the symmetry of the scattering object. We verify our statement by means of numerical simulations and experimental data.

We then extend this to atoms arranged on a helix as found in crystals which belong to chiral space groups and propose a method to determine the handedness of such crystals by looking at the symmetry of the diffraction pattern. In contrast to alternative methods, our technique does not require multiple scattering, which makes it possible to also investigate extremely thin samples in which multiple scattering is suppressed.

Instead of writing the scattering amplitude in Fourier space as a set of plane waves, we use the cylindrical Fourier transform to describe the scattering amplitude in a basis of orbital angular momentum (OAM) eigenstates. We show how working in this framework can be very convenient when investigating, e.g., rotation and screw-axis symmetries. For the latter we find selection rules on the OAM coefficients that unambiguously reveal the handedness of the screw axis. Detecting the OAM coefficients of the scattering amplitude thus offers the possibility to detect the handedness of crystals without the need for dynamical simulations, the thickness of the sample, nor the exact crystal structure. We propose an experimental setup to measure the OAM components where an image of the crystal is taken after inserting a spiral phase plate in the diffraction plane and perform multislice simulations on a quartz to demonstrate how the method indeed reveals the chirality. The experimental feasibility of the technique is discussed together with its main advantages with respect to chirality determination of screw axes. The method shows how the use of a spiral phase plate can be extended from a simple phase imaging technique to a tool to measure the local OAM decomposition of an electron wave, widening the field of interest well beyond chiral space group determination.","312483","Open Access","0.2128","-0.5278","11","Electron vortex beams, Physics - optics, Orbital angular momentum","Electron vortex beams, Physics - optics, Orbital angular momentum","7",NA,NA,"",""

The structural and optical properties of the QDisks were probed by high spatial resolution cathodoluminescence (CL) in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). By exciting the QDisks with a nanometric electron beam at currents spanning over 3 orders of magnitude, strong non-linearities (energy shifts) in the light emission are observed. In particular, we find that the amount of energy shift depends on the emission rate and on the QDisk morphology (size, position along the NW and shell thickness). For thick QDisks (>4nm), the QDisk emission energy is observed to blue-shift with the increase of the emission intensity. This is interpreted as a consequence of the increase of carriers density excited by the incident electron beam inside the QDisks, which screens the internal electric field and thus reduces the quantum confined Stark effect (QCSE) present in these QDisks. For thinner QDisks (<3 nm), the blue-shift is almost absent in agreement with the negligible QCSE at such sizes. For QDisks of intermediate sizes there exists a current threshold above which the energy shifts, marking the transition from unscreened to partially screened QCSE. From the threshold value we estimate the lifetime in the unscreened regime. These observations suggest that, counterintuitively, electrons of high energy can behave ultimately as single electron-hole pair generators. In addition, when we increase the current from 1 pA to 10 pA the light emission efficiency drops by more than one order of magnitude. This reduction of the emission efficiency is a manifestation of the efficiency droop as observed in nitride-based 2D light emitting diodes, a phenomenon tentatively attributed to the Auger effect.","312483","Open Access","-0.3815","0.065","10","Quantum dots, Solar cells, Confined stark effect","Quantum dots, Solar cells, Confined stark effect","7","21","2","",""

Many related applications require nanoparticles with tailored magnetic properties. However, despite significant efforts undertaken towards this goal, a broad and poorly understood dispersion of magnetic properties is reported, even within monodisperse samples of the canonical ferromagnetic 3d transition metals. We address this issue by investigating the magnetism of a large number of size- and shape-selected, individual nanoparticles of Fe, Co, and Ni using a unique set of complementary characterization techniques. At room temperature, only superparamagnetic behavior is observed in our experiments for all Ni nanoparticles within the investigated sizes, which range from 8 to 20 nm. However, Fe and Co nanoparticles can exist in two distinct magnetic states at any size in this range: (i) a superparamagnetic state, as expected from the bulk and surface anisotropies known for the respective materials and as observed for Ni, and (ii) a state with unexpected stable magnetization at room temperature. This striking state is assigned to significant modifications of the magnetic properties arising from metastable lattice defects in the core of the nanoparticles, as concluded by calculations and atomic structural characterization. Also related with the structural defects, we find that the magnetic state of Fe and Co nanoparticles can be tuned by thermal treatment enabling one to tailor their magnetic properties for applications. This paper demonstrates the importance of complementary single particle investigations for a better understanding of nanoparticle magnetism and for full exploration of their potential for applications.","312483","Open Access","0.3358","0.3273","1","Article, Interferometric methods, Magnetic properties","Article, Interferometric methods, Magnetic properties","1",NA,NA,"",""

As such, the positions of atom columns can be measured with a precision of the order of a few picometres, even though the resolution of the electron microscope is still one or two orders of magnitude larger. Moreover, small differences in average atomic number, which cannot be distinguished visually, can be quantified using high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy images.

In nanoparticle assemblies, chirality has been shown to arise through a few different processes, but chiral organizations composed of plate-like nanoparticles, a class of material under scrutiny due to their wide applicative potential, have not yet been reported. We show that ribbons of stacked board-shaped cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanoplatelets (NPLs) twist upon the addition of oleic acid ligand, leading to chiral ribbons that reach several micrometers in length and display a well-defined pitch of ~400 nm. We demonstrate that the chirality originates from surface strain caused by the ligand because isolated NPLs in dilute solution undergo a transition from a flat to a twisted shape as the ligand coverage increases. When the platelets are closely stacked within ribbons, the individual twist propagates over the whole ribbon length. These results show that a ligand-induced mechanical stress can strongly distort thin NPLs and that this stress can be expressed at a larger scale, paving the way to stress engineering in assemblies of nanocrystals. Such a structural change resulting from a simple external stimulus could have broad implications for the design of sensors and other responsive materials.","661199","Open Access","-0.2844","0.6343","3","Walled carbon nanotubes, Case study, Additional data file","Walled carbon nanotubes, Case study, Additional data file","3","17","11","",""

Most of these results were obtained with nanometer-scale resolution, but different approaches have recently pushed the resolution to the atomic level. Such information is a prerequisite to understand the specific relationship between the atomic structure and the physicochemical properties of (nano) materials. We provide an overview of the latest progress in the field of atomic-resolution electron tomography. Different imaging and reconstruction approaches are presented, and state-of-the-art results are discussed. This article demonstrates the power and importance of electron tomography with atomic-scale resolution.","312483","Closed Access","-0.1176","-0.3392","5","Resolution electron tomography, Haadf stem, Reconstruction technique","Resolution electron tomography, Haadf stem, Reconstruction technique","3","10","2","",""

The structure was investigated using a combination of high angle annular dark field imaging and electron energy loss spectroscopy spectrum imaging in the scanning transmission electron microscope. A three-dimensional model was constructed by combining the position and chemistry data with previous results and assuming octahedral coordination of all Fe and Ti atoms. The resulting structure shows some novel L shaped arrangements of iron columns, which are coordinated in a similar manner to FeO6 octahedra in maghemite. It is suggested that this may lead to local ferromagnetic orderings similar to those in maghemite.","312483","Open Access","-0.2835","-0.0818","9","Electron energy loss, Condensed matter::materials science, Energy loss spectroscopy","Electron energy loss, Condensed matter::materials science, Energy loss spectroscopy","",NA,NA,"",""

The structure-properties correlation raises complex questions due to the collective structure of these systems, often granular and porous, a crucial factor impacting their effectiveness and performance. In this framework, we investigate the optical and morphological properties of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) films and of Ag NPs/TiO2 porous matrix films, one-step grown by supersonic cluster beam deposition. Morphology and structure of the Ag NPs film and of the Ag/TiO2 (Ag/Ti 50-50) nanocomposite are related to the optical properties of the film employing spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). We employ a simple Bruggeman effective medium approximation model, corrected by finite size effects of the nano-objects in the film structure to gather information on the structure and morphology of the nanocomposites, in particular porosity and average NPs size for the Ag/TiO2 NP film. Our results suggest that SE is a simple, quick and effective method to measure porosity of nanoscale films and systems, where standard methods for measuring pore sizes might not be applicable.","312483","Open Access","0.0168","0.4764","6","Antiferromagnetic order, Epitaxially strained, Mno thin films","Antiferromagnetic order, Epitaxially strained, Mno thin films","0",NA,NA,"",""
