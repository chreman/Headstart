Analysis requirements are relatively familiar: analysts wish to identify, define and compare sets of crime reports across multiple attributes (space, time and description). A challenge particular to the domain, identified through workshops with Police analysts in Belgium and the UK, is in developing exploratory data analysis software that offers some sophistication in data selection, aggregation and comparison, but with interaction techniques and representations that can be easily understood, navigated and communicated. In light of ongoing discussion with Police analysts, we propose four visual design and interaction maxims that relate to this challenge and discuss an early visual analysis prototype that we hope conforms to these maxims.","608142","Open Access","0.2166","-0.0725","6","","",NA,NA,NA,"",""

Their performance is usually evaluated by comparing the produced alignments to a reference alignment in terms of precision, recall and F-measure. These measures, however, only provide an overall assessment of the quality of the alignments, but do not reveal differences and commonalities between alignments at a finer-grained level such as, e.g., regions or individual mappings. Furthermore, reference alignments are often unavailable , which makes the comparative exploration of alignments at different levels of granularity even more important. Making such comparisons efficient calls for a \" human-in-the-loop \" approach, best supported through interactive visual representations of alignments. Our approach extends a recent tool, Matrix Cubes, used for visualizing dense dynamic networks. We first identify use cases for ontology alignment evaluation that can benefit from interactive visualization, and then detail how our Alignment Cubes support interactive exploration of multiple ontology alignments. We demonstrate the usefulness of Alignment Cubes by describing visual exploration scenarios, showing how alignment cubes support common tasks identified in the use cases.","608142","Open Access","-0.6405","-0.0696","8","Ontology alignment evaluation","Ontology alignment evaluation","0",NA,NA,"",""

For DR techniques to be useful in exploratory data analysis, they need to be adapted to human needs and domain-specific problems, ideally, interactively, and on-the-fly. Many visual analytics systems have already demonstrated the benefits of tightly integrating DR with interactive visualizations. Nevertheless, a general, structured understanding of this integration is missing. To address this, we systematically studied the visual analytics and visualization literature to investigate how analysts interact with automatic DR techniques. The results reveal seven common interaction scenarios that are amenable to interactive control such as specifying algorithmic constraints, selecting relevant features, or choosing among several DR algorithms. We investigate specific implementations of visual analysis systems integrating DR, and analyze ways that other machine learning methods have been combined with DR. Summarizing the results in a “human in the loop” process model provides a general lens for the evaluation of visual interactive DR systems. We apply the proposed model to study and classify several systems previously described in the literature, and to derive future research opportunities.","608142","Open Access","-0.2242","0.1129","1","Dimensionality reduction","Dimensionality reduction","15","6","95","",""

This paper explores two related approaches to quantifying the confidence we may have in making visual inferences from mapped geospatial data. We adapt Wickham et al.’s ‘Visual Line-up’ method as a direct analogy with Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) and propose a new approach for generating more credible spatial null hypotheses. Rather than using as a spatial null hypothesis the unrealistic assumption of complete spatial randomness, we propose spatially autocorrelated simulations as alternative nulls. We conduct a set of crowdsourced experiments (n = 361) to determine the just noticeable difference (JND) between pairs of choropleth maps of geographic units controlling for spatial autocorrelation (Moran’s I statistic) and geometric configuration (variance in spatial unit area). Results indicate that people’s abilities to perceive differences in spatial autocorrelation vary with baseline autocorrelation structure and the geometric configuration of geographic units. These results allow us, for the first time, to construct a visual equivalent of statistical power for geospatial data. Our JND results add to those provided in recent years by Klippel et al. (2011), Harrison et al. (2014) and Kay & Heer (2015) for correlation visualization. Importantly, they provide an empirical basis for an improved construction of visual line-ups for maps and the development of theory to inform geospatial tests of graphical inference.","656741","Open Access","-0.1195","0.5209","12","","","3",NA,NA,"",""

This concurrent analysis becomes difficult when data are grouped and split into small multiples for comparison. A design challenge is thus to provide representations that enable multiple perspectives, split into small multiples, to be viewed simultaneously in ways that neither clutter nor overload. We present a design framework that allows us to do this. We claim that multi-perspective comparison across small multiples may be possible by superimposing perspectives on one another rather than juxtaposing those perspectives side-by-side. This approach defies conventional wisdom and likely results in visual and informational clutter. For this reason we propose designs at three levels of abstraction for each perspective. By flexibly varying the abstraction level, certain perspectives can be brought into, or out of, focus. We evaluate our framework through laboratory-style user tests. We find that superimposing, rather than juxtaposing, perspective views has little effect on performance of a low-level comparison task. We reflect on the user study and its design to further identify analysis situations for which our framework may be desirable. Although the user study findings were insufficiently discriminating, we believe our framework opens up a new design space for multi-perspective visual analysis.","608142","Open Access","0.5065","0.3273","10","Qa75","Qa75","3",NA,NA,"",""

The Anatomy track was started in 2005. In 2005 and 2006 the task in this track was to align the Foundational Model of Anatomy and the OpenGalen Anatomy Model. Since 2007 the ontologies used in the track are the Adult Mouse Anatomy and a part of the NCI Thesaurus. Since 2015 the data in the Anatomy track is also used in the Interactive track of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative. Results: In this paper we focus on the Anatomy track in the years 2007-2016 and the Anatomy part of the Interactive track in 2015-2016. We describe the data set and the changes it went through during the years. Further, we give an overview of all systems that participated in the track and the techniques they have used. We discuss the performance results of the systems and summarize the general trends. Conclusions: About 50 systems have participated in the Anatomy track. Many different techniques were used. The most popular matching techniques are string-based strategies and structure-based techniques. Many systems also use auxiliary information. The quality of the alignment has increased for the best performing systems since the beginning of the track and more and more systems check the coherence of the proposed alignment and implement a repair strategy.Further, interacting with an oracle is beneficial.
