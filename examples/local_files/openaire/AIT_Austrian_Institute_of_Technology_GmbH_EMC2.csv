Dubrovnik, Croatia.
			In mixed-criticality multicore systems, the appropriate degree of isolation between applications of different criticalities is a primary objective. However, efficient utilization of the platform’s processing capacity and other resources is still desirable and important. In recent work, we, therefore, proposed an approach that reclaims cache resources assigned to low-criticality tasks when these are dispensed with, in the event of a system mode change. The reclaimed cache resources are reassigned from the lower-criticality tasks to the remaining higher-criticality tasks to improve performance. The per-task cache partitions can either be configured to hold frequently accessed (“hot”) pages, locked in place, or they can be used dynamically, with cache lines moved in and out. The first option simplifies WCET analysis while the second option simplifies the act of cache reconfiguration at runtime. Meanwhile, the performance implications of the two options are not immediately obvious. Therefore, in this work-in-progress, we explore an arrangement that combines both approaches, in order to achieve the best tradeoff between efficient analysis, low reconfiguration overheads and good schedulability Simple per task cache partitions (without page locking) are to be used for the portion of the cache that is subject to reclamation. At mode switch, the high-criticality tasks keep the pages they had locked in the cache and get additional partitions, out of reclaimed cache, to bring other pages in and out as needed.

			The demand for extra functionality in modern applications

			increasing frequencies but with additional cores [1]. Therefore,
			in the last decade, the semiconductor industry has experienced
			a paradigm shift from single processor design to multicore
			processors (MCP). Cores in MCP share many resources like
			caches, main memory, I/O devices and interconnects. This
			sharing, which does not exist in single core processors, makes

			The state-of-the-art models and schedulability analysis for mixed-criticality multicore systems overlook low-level aspects of the system. To improve their credibility, we therefore incorprate, in this work, the effects of delays from memory contention on a shared bus. Specifically, to that end, we adopt the predictable memory reservation mechanism proposed by the Single Core Equivalence framework. Additionally, we explore how the reclamation, for higher-criticality tasks, of cache resources allocated to lower-criticality tasks, whenever there is a criticality (mode) change in the system, can improve schedulability.

			This paper explores the behavior of parallel fork-join tasks on multicore platforms by resorting to a semipartitioned
			scheduling model. This model offers a promising framework to embedded systems which are subject
			to stringent timing constraints as it provides these systems with very interesting properties. The proposed
			approach consists of two stages—an offline stage and an online stage. During the offline stage, a multi-frame task
			model is adopted to perform the fork-join task-to-core mapping so as to improve the schedulability and the
			performance of the system, and during the online stage, work-stealing is exploited among cores to improve the
			system responsiveness as well as to balance the execution workload. The objective of this work is twofold: (1) to
			provide an alternative technique that takes advantage of the semi-partitioned scheduling properties by offering
			the possibility to accommodate fork-join tasks that cannot be scheduled in any pure partitioned environment, and
			(2) to reduce the migration overhead which has shown to be a traditional major source of non-determinism in
			global approaches. The simulation results show an improvement of the proposed approach over the state-of-theart
			of up to 15% of the average response-time per task set.","137225","Open Access","-0.0375","-0.2279","9","Mixed criticality scheduling, Semi partitioned, Upper bound","Mixed criticality scheduling, Semi partitioned, Upper bound",NA,NA,NA,"",""

			Verification and testing are two of the most costly and time consuming steps during the development of safety critical systems. The advent of complex and sometimes partially unpredictable computing architectures such as multicore commercial-of-the-shelf platforms, together with the composable development approach adopted in multiple industrial domains such as avionics and automotive, rendered the exhaustive testing of all situations that could potentially be encountered by the system once deployed on the field nearly impossible. Run-time verification (RV) is a promising solution to help accelerate the development of safety critical applications whilst maintaining the high degree of reliability required by such systems. RV adds monitors in the application, which check at run-time if the system is behaving according to predefined specifications. In case of deviations from the specifications during the runtime, safeguarding measures can be triggered in order to keep the system and its environment in a safe state, as well as potentially attempting to recover from the fault that caused the misbehaviour. Most of the state-of-the-art on RV essentially focused on the monitor generation, concentrating on the expressiveness of the specification language and its translation in correct-by-construction monitors. Few of them addressed the problem of designing an efficient and safe run-time monitoring (RM) architecture. Yet, RM is a key component for RV. The RM layer gathers information from the monitored application and transmits it to the monitors. Therefore, without an efficient and safe RM architecture, the whole RV system becomes useless, as its inputs and hence by extension its outputs cannot be trusted. In this paper, we discuss the design of a novel RM architecture suited to safety critical applications.","137225","Open Access","-0.2446","0.4509","4","Monitoring architecture, Run time monitoring, Runtime verification","Monitoring architecture, Run time monitoring, Runtime verification","0",NA,NA,"",""

			Purely analytical worst-case execution time (WCET) estimation approaches for Graphics Processor Units (GPUs) cannot go far because of insufficient public information for the hardware. Therefore measurement-based probabilistic timing analysis (MBPTA) seems the way forward. We recently demonstrated MBPTA for GPUs, based on Extreme Value Theory (EVT) of the “Block Maxima” paradigm. In this newer work, we formulate and experimentally evaluate a more robust MBPTA approach based on the EVT “Peak over Threshold” paradigm with a complete set of tests for verifying EVT applicability. It optimally selects parameters to best-fit the input measurements for more accurate probabilistic WCET estimates. Different system configuration parameters (cache arrangements, thread block size) and their effect on the pWCET are considered, enhancing models of worst-case GPU behavior.

			In this work, we present four different implementations of a run-time monitoring framework suited to real-time and safety critical systems. Two implementations are written in Ada and follow the Ravenscar profile, which make them particularly suited to the development of high integrity systems. The first version is available as a standalone library for Ada programs while the second has been integrated in the GNAT run-time environment and instruments the ORK+ micro-kernel. Information on the task scheduling events, directly originating from the kernel, can thus be used by the monitors to check if the system follows all its requirements. The third implementation is a standalone library written in C++ that can be used in any POSIX compliant run-time environment. It is therefore compatible with the vast majority of operating systems used in embedded systems. The last implementation is a loadable kernel module for Linux. It has for main advantage to be able to enforce complete space partitioning between the monitors and the monitored applications. It is therefore impossible for memory faults to propagate and corrupt the state of the monitors.

This update came as a response to the steady increase of the number and complexity of the software functions embedded in modern vehicles, which call for the computing power of multicore execution environments. In this paper, we enumerate and analyze the design options and the challenges of porting AUTOSAR-based automotive applications onto multicore platforms. In particular, we investigate those options when considering the emerging many- core architectures that provide a more scalable environment than the traditional multicore systems. Such platforms are suitable to enable massive parallel execution, and their design is more suitable for partitioning and isolating the software components.

			Next generations of compute-intensive real-time applications in automotive systems will require more powerful computing platforms. One promising power-efficient solution for such applications is to use clustered many-core architectures. However, ensuring that real-time requirements are satisfied in the presence of contention in shared resources, such as memories, remains an open issue. This work presents a novel contention-free execution framework to execute automotive applications on such platforms. Privatization of memory banks together with defined access phases to shared memory resources is the backbone of the framework. An Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation is presented to find the optimal time-triggered schedule for the on-core execution as well as for the access to shared memory. Additionally a heuristic solution is presented that generates the schedule in a fraction of the time required by the ILP. Extensive evaluations show that the proposed heuristic performs only 0.5% away from the optimal solution while it outperforms a baseline heuristic by 67%. The applicability of the approach to industrially sized problems is demonstrated in a case study of a software for Engine Management Systems.

			This paper considers the problem of reducing the number of preemptions in a system with periodic tasks and preemption overhead. The proposed solution is based on the key observation that for periodic task sets, the task with the smallest period plays an important role in determining the maximum interval of time during which a lower priority task can be executed without being preempted. We use this property to build a new limited preemptive scheduling algorithm, named RSLP, based on fixed-priority scheduling. In RS-LP, the length of each task’s non-preemptive region is varying during the system execution so as to keep the preemptions aligned with the releases of the highest priority task. This simple mechanism allows us to reduce the overall number of preemptions. The proposed algorithm, decides whether or not to preempt the currently executing task based on the maximum blocking tolerance of the higher priority tasks. In any case, the preemptions are authorized only at release instants of the task with the smallest period, thereby limiting the maximum number of preemptions to the number of releases of the highest priority task. Moreover, in this paper, we provide two different preemption overhead aware schedulability tests for periodic and loose-harmonic task sets (i.e., where each period is an integer multiple of the smallest period), together with a lower bound on the maximum number of preemptions. To conclude, extensive experiments comparing RS-LP with the state of the art limited preemptive scheduling algorithms are finally presented.

			A task can be preempted by several jobs of higher priority tasks during its response time. Assuming the worst-case memory demand for each of these jobs leads to pessimistic worstcase response time (WCRT) estimations. Indeed, there is a big chance that a large portion of the instructions and data associated with the preempting task τj are still available in the cache when τj releases its next jobs. Accounting for this observation allows the pessimism of WCRT analysis to be significantly reduced, which is not considered by existing work. The four main contributions of this paper are: 1) The concept of persistent cache blocks is introduced in the context of WCRT analysis, which allows re-use of cache blocks to be captured, 2) A cache-persistence-aware WCRT analysis for fixed-priority preemptive systems exploiting the PCBs to reduce the WCRT bound, 3) An multi-set extension of the analysis that further improves the WCRT bound, and 4) An evaluation showing that our cache-persistence-aware WCRT analysis results in up to 10% higher schedulability than state-of-the-art approaches.

			Many real-time systems include tasks that need to suspend their execution in order to externalize some of their operations or to wait for data, events or shared resources. Although commonly encountered in real-world systems, study of their timing analysis is still limited due to the problem complexity. In this paper, we invalidate a claim made in one of the earlier works [1], that led to the common belief that the timing analysis of one self-suspending task interacting with non-self-suspending sporadic tasks is much easier than in the periodic case. This work highlights the complexity of the problem and presents a method to compute the exact worst-case response time (WCRT) of a self-suspending task with one suspension region. However, as the complexity of the analysis might rapidly grow with the number of tasks, we also define an optimization formulation to compute an upper-bound on the WCRT for tasks with multiple suspendion regions. In the experiments, our optimization framework outperforms all previous analysis techniques and often finds the exact WCRT.","611016","Open Access","-0.0853","-0.5013","7","Response time analysis, Timing analysis, Fixed priority","Response time analysis, Timing analysis, Fixed priority","2",NA,NA,"",""

			SDRAM is a shared resource in modern multi-core platforms executing multiple real-time (RT) streaming applications. It is crucial to analyze the minimum guaranteed SDRAM bandwidth to ensure that the requirements of the RT streaming applications are always satisfied. However, deriving the worst-case bandwidth (WCBW) is challenging because of the diverse memory traffic with variable transaction sizes. In fact, existing RT memory controllers either do not efficiently support variable transaction sizes or do not provide an analysis to tightly bound WCBW in their presence.
			We propose a new mode-controlled data-flow (MCDF) model to capture the command scheduling dependencies of memory transactions with variable sizes. The WCBW can be obtained by employing an existing tool to automatically analyze our MCDF model rather than using existing static analysis techniques, which in contrast to our model are hard to extend to cover different RT memory controllers. Moreover, the MCDF analysis can exploit static information about known transaction sequences provided by the applications or by the memory arbiter. Experimental results show that 77% improvement of WCBW can be achieved compared to the case without known transaction sequences. In addition, the results demonstrate that the proposed MCDF model outperforms state-of-the-art analysis approaches and improves the WCBW by 22% without known transaction sequences.","147439","Open Access","0.4434","-0.3226","14","Memory controllers","Memory controllers","3",NA,NA,"",""

			Timely delivery of critical traffic is a major challenge in industrial applications. The Wireless Dominance (WiDOM) medium access control protocol offers a very large number of priority levels to suit time sensitive application requirements. In particular, assuming that its overhead is properly modeled, WiDOM enables an accurate evaluation of the network response time in the wireless domain, through the power of the schedulability analysis, based on non-preemptive and staticpriority scheduling. Recent research proposed a new version of WiDOM (dubbed Slotted WiDOM), which offers a lower overhead as compared to the original version. In this paper, we propose a new schedulability analysis for Slotted WiDOM and extend it to handle message streams with release jitter. In order to provide a more accurate timing analysis, the effect of transmission faults must be taken into account. Therefore, in our novel analysis we consider the case where messages are transmitted in a realistic wireless channel, affected by noise and interference. Evaluation is performed on a real test-bed and the results from experiments provide a firm validation of our findings.","147439","Open Access","-0.1877","-0.6618","7","Response time analysis, Timing analysis, Fixed priority","Response time analysis, Timing analysis, Fixed priority","0",NA,NA,"",""

			Concurrent programming is dominated by thread based solutions with lock based critical sections. Careful attention has to be paid to avoid race and deadlock conditions. Real-Time for The Masses (RTFM) takes an alternative language approach, introducing tasks and named critical sections (via resources) natively in the RTFM-core language. RTFM-core programs can be compiled to native C-code, and efficiently executed onto single-core platforms under the Stack Resource Policy (SRP) by the RTFM-kernel. In this paper we formally define the well-formedness criteria for SRP based resource management, and develop a certified (formally proven) implementation of the corresponding compilation from nested critical sections of the input RTFM-core program to a resulting flat sequence of primitive operations and scheduling primitives. Moreover we formalise the properties for resource ceilings under SRP and develop a certified algorithm for their computation. The feasibility of the described approach is shown through the adoption of the Why3 platform, which allows the necessary verification conditions to be automatically generated and discharged through a variety of automatic external SMT-solvers and interactive theorem provers. Moreover, Why3 supports the extraction of certified Ocaml code for proven implementations in WhyML. As a proof of concept the certified extracted development is demonstrated on an example system.

			Commercial-of-the-shelf based multi-core systems present timing anomalies that cannot be ignored by the real-time systems community due to their unpredictable behaviour. These timing anomalies, often caused by applications’ uncontrolled accesses to shared resources such as the components in the memory hierarchy or in the I/O subsystem, introduce interference that may lead to deadline misses if the problem is neglected. The Acquisition Execution Restitution (AER) execution model was previously proposed to circumvent this problem and, therefore, mitigate inter-task interference. In this model, applications decouple communication (acquisition and restitution phases) from the actual execution in a way that at most one acquisition or restitution phase is in execution at any instant of time while the execution phase of different tasks can progress in parallel on multiple cores. Thus, keeping each task’s derived worst-case execution time closer to the one measured in isolation. In this paper, we study the AER execution model and compare it against a global Earliest Deadline First (EDF) approach where interferences are considered. Our results show that a priority assignment heuristic which assigns the priorities based on the tasks’ periods dominates all the other proposed heuristics and that due to interference it can also schedule task sets which are not schedulable by using the global EDF approach.

			In modern multi-core systems with multiple real-time (RT) applications, memory traffic accessing the shared SDRAM is increasingly diverse, e.g., transactions have variable sizes. RT memory controllers with dynamic command scheduling can efficiently address the diversity by issuing appropriate commands subject to the SDRAM timing constraints. However, the scheduling dependencies between commands make it challenging to derive tight bounds for the worst-case response time (WCRT) and the worst-case bandwidth (WCBW) of a memory controller. Existing modeling and analysis techniques either do not provide tight WCRT and WCBW bounds for diverse memory traffic with variable transaction sizes or are difficult to adapt to different RT memory controllers.
			This paper models a memory controller using Timed Automata (TA), where model checking is applied for analysis. Our TA model is modular and accurately captures the behavior of a RT memory controller with dynamic command scheduling. We obtain WCRT and WCBW bounds, which are validated by simulating the worst-case transaction traces obtained by model checking with a cycle-accurate model of the memory controller. Our method outperforms three state-of-the-art analysis techniques. We reduce WCRT bound by up to 20%, while the average improvement is 7.7%, and increase the WCBW bound by up to 25% with an average improvement of 13.6%. In addition, our modeling is generic enough to extend to memory controllers with different mechanisms.

This paper presents Parcus, an energy-and latency-aware parallelization technique that combines both runnable-and tasklevel parallelism. Parcus explicitly models the traversal of data from sensor to actuator through task instances, enabling to consider the latency imposed by parallelization techniques.

			Real-time systems are becoming more complex and open, thus increasing their development and verification costs. Although several static verification tools have been proposed over the last decades, they suffer from scalability and precision problems. As a result, the tools fail to cover all the necessary safety properties for realistic real-time applications involving a large number of components and tasks. Runtime verification is a formal technique that verifies properties during system execution with the support of monitors. The monitors are generated from formal languages using correct-by-construction generation methods. Runtime verification can thus be used as a complement or replacement for static verification approaches. The current state-of-the-art tools either do not have notion of time, or suffer from the potential blowup of states at run-time. In this paper, we propose REVERT, a framework developed with a focus on the verification of functional and non-functional properties with timing constraints. The contribution of this work is twofold: (i) a domain-specific specification language allowing the definition of requirements for real-time applications; (ii) a novel mechanism to generate monitors, with state-space and time guarantees, capable of identifying and reacting to timing properties defined with the proposed specification language.

			We highlight the pessimism of independently calculating cache-related preemption delays (CRPDs) and Cache Persistence Reload Overhead (CPRO). We propose a first solution to reduce that pessimism by integrating the calculation of CRPDs and CPROs. However, the proposed result is limited to the UCB-union and CPRO-union approaches. Two methods that are known to be simple but pessimistic. As future work, we will formally prove the correctness of the proposed approach and extend it to more evolved methods for the CRPD and CPRO computation. A thorough evaluation of the proposed result will also be conducted in order to quantify the actual gain over the state-of-the-art, as it is expected that the identified problem and its impact on the response time analysis may be very context dependent.

			Heterogeneous multicore platforms are becoming an attractive choice to deploy mixed criticality systems demanding diverse computational requirements. One of the major challenges is to efficiently harness the computational power of these multicore platforms while deploying mixed criticality applications with timeliness properties. Energy efficiency is also one of the desired requirements in the design phase, and therefore it is often difficult for the system designer to simultaneously satisfy those sometimes contradictory requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel partitioning algorithm for unrelated heterogeneous multicore platforms to map mixed criticality applications. The algorithm not only ensures the timeliness in different modes of execution but also tries to allocate the applications to their energy-wise favourite cores. We considered a realistic power model that further increases the relevance of the proposed approach. We have performed an extensive set of experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, and we show that in the best-case, we achieve a 23.8% gain in the average power dissipation over the state-ofthe-art partitioned algorithm. Our proposed algorithm also has a better weighted schedulability when compared to the existing partitioned algorithms.

			For real-time embedded systems, self-suspending behaviors can cause substantial performance/schedulability degradations. In this paper, we focus on preemptive fixed-priority scheduling for the dynamic self-suspension task model on uniprocessor. This model assumes that a job of a task can dynamically suspend itself during its execution (for instance, to wait for shared resources or access co-processors or external devices). The total suspension time of a job is upper-bounded, but this dynamic behavior drastically influences the interference generated by this task on lower-priority tasks. The state-of-the-art results for this task model can be classified into three categories (i) modeling suspension as computation, (ii) modeling suspension as release jitter, and (iii) modeling suspension as a blocking term. However, several results associated to the release jitter approach have been recently proven to be erroneous, and the concept of modeling suspension as blocking was never formally proven correct. This paper presents a unifying response time analysis framework for the dynamic self-suspending task model. We provide a rigorous proof and show that the existing analyses pertaining to the three categories mentioned above are analytically dominated by our proposed solution. Therefore, all those techniques are in fact correct, but they are inferior to the proposed response time analysis in this paper. The evaluation results show that our analysis framework can generate huge improvements (an increase of up to 50% of the number of task sets deemed schedulable) over these state-of-the-art analyses.

			The IEC 61499 standard proposes an event driven execution model for component based (in terms of Function Blocks), distributed industrial automation applications. However, the standard provides only an informal execution semantics, thusin consequence behavior and correctness relies on the design decisions made by the tool vendor. In this paper we present the formalization of a subset of the IEC 61499 standard in order to provide an underpinning for the static verification of Function Block models by means of deductive reasoning. Specifically, we contribute by addressing verification at the component,algorithm, and ECC levels. From Function Block descriptions, enrichedwith formal contracts, we show that correctness of component compositions, as well as functional and transitional behavior can be ensured. Feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by manually encoding a set of representative use-cases in WhyML,for which the verification conditions are automatically derived (through the Why3 platform) and discharged (using automaticSMT-based solvers). Furthermore, we discuss opportunities and challenges towards deriving certified executables for IEC 61499 models.

			With the rapid evolution of commercial hardware platforms, in most application domains, the industry has shown
			a growing interest in integrating and running independently-developed applications of different “criticalities” in the
			same multicore platform. Such integrated systems are commonly referred to as mixed-criticality systems (MCS).
			Most of the MCS-related research published in the state-of-the-art cite the safety-related standards associated to
			each application domain (e.g. aeronautics, space, railway, automotive) to justify their methods and results.
			However, those standards are not, in most cases, freely available, and do not always clearly and explicitly specify
			the requirements for mixed-criticality systems. This paper addresses the important challenge of unveiling the
			relevant information available in some of the safety-related standards, such that the mixed-criticality concept is
			understood from an industrialist’s perspective. Moreover, the paper evaluates the state-of-the-art mixed-criticality
			real-time scheduling models and algorithms against the safety-related standards and clarifies some
			misconceptions that are commonly encountered.","621429","Open Access","0.193","0.171","3","Core architectures, [info.info-es] computer science [cs]/embedded systems, Mixed criticality","Core architectures, [info.info-es] computer science [cs]/embedded systems, Mixed criticality","7",NA,NA,"",""

Extraction of timing parameters (offsets, deadlines, periods) from these applications enables the use of real-time scheduling and analysis techniques, and provides guarantees on satisfying timing constraints. However, existing extraction techniques require the transformation of the dataflow application from highly expressive dataflow computational models, for example, Synchronous Dataflow (SDF) and Cyclo-Static Dataflow (CSDF) to Homogeneous Synchronous Dataflow (HSDF). This transformation can lead to an exponential increase in the size of the application graph that significantly increases the runtime of the analysis.

			In this article, we address this problem by proposing an offline heuristic algorithm called slack-based merging. The algorithm is a novel graph reduction technique that helps in speeding up the process of timing parameter extraction and finding a feasible real-time schedule, thereby reducing the overall design time of the real-time system. It uses two main concepts: (a) the difference between the worst-case execution time of the SDF graph’s firings and its timing constraints (slack) to merge firings together and generate a reduced-size HSDF graph, and (b) the novel concept of merging called safe merge, which is a merge operation that we formally prove cannot cause a live HSDF graph to deadlock. The results show that the reduced graph (1) respects the throughput and latency constraints of the original application graph and (2) typically speeds up the process of extracting timing parameters and finding a feasible real-time schedule for real-time dataflow applications. They also show that when the throughput constraint is relaxed with respect to the maximal throughput of the graph, the merging algorithm is able to achieve a larger reduction in graph size, which in turn results in a larger speedup of the real-time scheduling algorithms.

In this article, we focus on deeply embedded devices, typically used for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, and demonstrate how to enable energy transparency through existing static resource analysis (SRA) techniques and a new target-agnostic profiling technique, without hardware energy measurements. Our novel mapping technique enables software energy consumption estimations at a higher level than the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), namely the LLVM intermediate representation (IR) level, and therefore introduces energy transparency directly to the LLVM optimizer. We apply our energy estimation techniques to a comprehensive set of benchmarks, including single- and multithreaded embedded programs from two commonly used concurrency patterns: task farms and pipelines. Using SRA, our LLVM IR results demonstrate a high accuracy with a deviation in the range of 1% from the ISA SRA.

			memories (cache or scratchpads), for a variety of memory bus arbitration policies, including: Round-Robin, FIFO,
			Fixed-Priority, Processor-Priority, and TDMA, and account for DRAM refreshes. The MRTA framework provides a
			general approach to timing verification for multicore systems that is parametric in the hardware configuration and
			so can be used at the architectural design stage to compare the guaranteed levels of performance that can be
			obtained with different hardware configurations. The MRTA framework decouples response time analysis from a
			reliance on context independent WCET values. Instead, the analysis formulates response times directly from the

			Scheduling isolation in mixed-criticality systems is challenging without sacrificing performance. In response, we propose a scheduling approach that combines server-based semi-partitioning and deadline scaling. Semi-partitioning (whereby only some tasks migrate, in a carefully managed manner), hitherto used in single criticality systems, offers good performance with low overheads. Deadline-scaling selectively prioritizes high-criticality tasks in parts of the schedule to ensure their deadlines are met even in rares case of execution time overrun. Our new algorithm NPS-F-MC brings semi-partitioning to mixed-criticality scheduling and uses Ekberg and Yi’s state-of-the-art deadline scaling approach. It ensures scheduling isolation among different-criticality tasks and only allows low-criticality task migration. We also explore variants that disallow migration entirely or relax the isolation between different criticalities (SP-EKB) in order to evaluate the performance tradeoffs associated with more flexible or rigid safety and isolation requirements.

			The design of mixed-criticality systems often involves painful tradeoffs between safety guarantees
			and performance. However, the use of more detailed architectural models in the design and
			analysis of scheduling arrangements for mixed-criticality systems can provide greater confidence
			in the analysis, but also opportunities for better performance. Motivated by this view, we propose
			an extension of Vestal’s model for mixed-criticality multicore systems that (i) accounts for the
			per-task partitioning of the last-level cache and (ii) supports the dynamic reassignment, for
			better schedulability, of cache portions initially reserved for lower-criticality tasks to the highercriticality
			tasks, when the system switches to high-criticality mode. To this model, we apply
			partitioned EDF scheduling with Ekberg and Yi’s deadline-scaling technique. Our schedulability
			analysis and scalefactor calculation is cognisant of the cache resources assigned to each task, by
			using WCET estimates that take into account these resources. It is hence able to leverage the
			dynamic reconfiguration of the cache partitioning, at mode change, for better performance, in
			terms of provable schedulability. We also propose heuristics for partitioning the cache in lowand
			high-criticality mode, that promote schedulability. Our experiments with synthetic task sets,
			indicate tangible improvements in schedulability compared to a baseline cache-aware arrangement
			where there is no redistribution of cache resources from low- to high-criticality tasks in the event
			of a mode change.
