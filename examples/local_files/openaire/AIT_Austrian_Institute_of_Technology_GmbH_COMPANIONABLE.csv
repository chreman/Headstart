The multi-sensor fusion can provide more accurate and reliable information compared to information provided by each sensor separately. Furthermore, data from multiple heterogeneous sensors present in the remote home healthcare monitoring systems have different degrees of imperfection and trust. Among the multi-sensor fusion techniques, belief methods based on Dempster-Shafer Theory are currently considered as the most appropriate for the representation and processing of imperfect information, thus allowing a more realistic modeling of the problem. Based on a graphical representation of the Dempster-Shafer called Evidential Networks, a structure of heterogeneous data fusion from multiple sensors for fall detection has been proposed in order to maximize the performance of automatic fall detection and thus make the system more reliable. Sensors’ non-stationary signals of the considered system may lead to degradation of the experimental conditions and make Evidential Networks inconsistent in their decisions. In order to compensate the sensors signals non-stationarity effects, the time evolution is taken into account by introducing the Dynamic Evidential Networks which was evaluated by the simulated fall scenarios corresponding to various use cases; Ces travaux de recherche se sont déroulés dans le cadre du développement d’une application de télévigilance médicale ayant pour but de détecter des situations de détresse à travers l’utilisation de plusieurs types de capteurs. La fusion multi-capteurs peut fournir des informations plus précises et fiables par rapport aux informations provenant de chaque capteur prises séparément. Par ailleurs les données issues de ces capteurs hétérogènes possèdent différents degrés d’imperfection et de confiance. Parmi les techniques de fusion multi-capteurs, les méthodes crédibilistes fondées sur la théorie de Dempster-Shafer sont actuellement considérées comme les plus adaptées à la représentation et au traitement des informations imparfaites, de ce fait permettant une modélisation plus réaliste du problème. En nous appuyant sur une représentation graphique de la théorie de Dempster-Shafer appelée Réseaux Évidentiels, nous proposons une structure de fusion de données hétérogènes issues de plusieurs capteurs pour la détection de chutes afin de maximiser les performances de détection chutes et ainsi de rendre le système plus fiable. La non-stationnarité des signaux recueillis sur les capteurs du système considéré peut conduire à une dégradation des conditions expérimentales, pouvant rendre les Réseaux Évidentiels incohérents dans leurs décisions. Afin de compenser les effets résultant de la non-stationnarité des signaux provenant des capteurs, les Réseaux Évidentiels sont rendus évolutifs dans le temps, ce qui nous a conduit à introduire les Réseaux Evidentiels Dynamiques dans nos traitements et à les évaluer sur des scénarios de chute simulés correspondant à des cas d’usage variés","216487","Open Access","0.3306","0.5239","4","Evidential networks","Evidential networks",NA,NA,NA,"",""

With the progress of medicine they may be kept longer in their homes but are more fragile and therefore require technical solutions to make it easier for caregivers and increase the comfort of these people. This manuscript provides a summary of research activities conducted by the author in the field of medical remote monitoring. These research activities are structured in two themes: sound environment analysis and multimodal data fusion. The sound environment is very rich in information that can be used to detect or to predict distress, either directly or through the analysis of the activities of the person. The sound analysis is subject to the constraints of the remote audio acquisition, the presence of noise from outside and the large variability in recognizing sounds. The manuscript describes different solutions evaluated and their practical implementation in the framework of several European and national research projects. The second theme is represented by merging the output of the noise analysis with other sensors to improve the robustness of the system. Data fusion must process signals of different nature (binary or continuous), with different sample rates and different types (periodic or asynchronous). Two techniques (fuzzy logic and evidence networks) are studied, adapted and evaluated in the same research projects. This manuscript concludes with the research perspectives of the author. Six scientific papers are added in the appendix.; La télévigilance médicale représente un enjeu de la société d'aujourd'hui. En effet l'espérance de vie augmente dans tous les pays industrialisés et les prévisions statistiques annoncent un nombre important de personnes âgées (17% de 60-74 ans en 2030) ou très âgées (12% de plus 75 ans en 2030). Grâce à la progression de la médecine ces personnes peuvent être maintenues plus longtemps à leur domicile mais demeurent plus fragiles et nécessitent donc des solutions techniques permettant d'améliorer leur confort et de faciliter la tâche des aidants. Ce mémoire donne une synthèse des activités de recherche menées par l'auteur dans le domaine de la télévigilance médicale. Cette recherche est structurée en deux axes : l'analyse de l'environnement sonore et la fusion de données multimodales. L'environnement sonore est très riche en informations utilisables, directement ou à travers l'analyse des activités de la personne pour détecter ou prévoir une situation de détresse. L'analyse sonore est soumise aux contraintes de l'acquisition sonore distante, à la présence des bruits provenant de l'extérieur et à la grande variabilité des sons à reconnaître. Le manuscrit décrit différentes solutions adoptées, leur mise en oeuvre et leur évaluation dans le cadre de plusieurs projets de recherche nationaux et européens. Le deuxième axe porte sur la fusion de la sortie de l'analyse sonore avec d'autres capteurs en vue d'améliorer la robustesse du système. La fusion de données doit traiter des signaux de natures différentes (signaux binaires ou continus), avec des périodicités différentes et de différentes temporalités (périodiques ou asynchrones). Deux techniques (logique floue et réseaux d'évidence) sont étudiées, adaptées et évaluées dans plusieurs projets de recherche. Le mémoire se termine avec les perspectives de recherche de l'auteur. Six publications scientifiques sont finalement annexées.","216487","Open Access","0.1357","0.6077","3","Data fusion","Data fusion",NA,NA,NA,"",""

Our method is fully automatic and applicable to an arbitrary set of Haar-like features. The parser reduces the number of memory accesses which are the main computational bottleneck during convolution on modern computer architectures. It first splits the features into simpler kernels. Then it aligns and reuses them where applicable forming an ensemble of recursive convolution trees, which can be computed faster. This is illustrated with experiments, which show a significant speed-up over the classic approach.","216487","Open Access","-0.7354","0.1659","11","Vectors","Vectors",1,NA,NA,"",""

But independent lifestyles come with risks and challenges. Medical in-home telemonitoring (and, more generally, telemedicine) is a solution to deal with these challenges and to ensure that elderly people can live safely and independently in their own homes for as long as possible. In this context we propose an automatic in-home healthcare monitoring system for several uses and to meet the needs identified above. The proposed telemonitoring system is a multimodal platform with several sensors that can be installed at home and enables us to have a full and tightly controlled universe of data sets. It integrates elderly physiological and behavioral data, the acoustical environment of the elderly, environmental conditions and medical knowledge. Each modality is processed and analyzed by specific algorithms. A data fusion approach based on fuzzy logic with a set of rules directed by medical recommendations, is used to fuse the various subsystem outputs. This multimodal fusion increases the reliability of the whole system by detecting several distress situations. In fact this fusion approach takes into account temporary sensor malfunction and increases the system reliability and the robustness in the case of environmental disturbances or material limits (Battery, RF range, etc.). The Fuzzy logic fusion methods brings high flexibility to the telemonitoring platform especially in combining modalities or adding other sensors. The proposed telemonitoring system will ensure pervasive in-home health monitoring for elderly people","216487","Open Access","2e-04","0.2348","1","Fuzzy control","Fuzzy control",19,"1","46","",""

The smart environment assists these people and their families with safety and cognitive stimulation, so they stay as long as possible at home. The originality comes from using the robot in the elderly person's home. This robot is remote controlled by a distant user, a therapist or a relative, for determining alarming situations or for participating in stimulation exercises. Several modes are available for controlling the robot. This paper deals with an assisted control mode in which the remote user gives to the robot one goal and the robot reaches the goal by itself. During the robot movement, the user can dynamically change the current goal. An important hypothesis is that the robot has no a priori knowledge of its environment at the beginning. The knowledge will increase with time and the planned trajectory will be refreshed at two levels: a local one - faster but not always sufficient - and a global one - slower but which always finds a path if one exists. The idea is to work only with local information, using the robot sensors, the operator keeping the high level control. To assure that control, the remote operator uses video feedback and information from a laser range scanner.","216487","Open Access","-0.212","-0.2999","5","[info.info-rb] computer science [cs]/robotics [cs.ro]","[info.info-rb] computer science [cs]/robotics [cs.ro]",0,NA,NA,"",""

Their use, at a first glance, is founded on the good qualities of GMM models when aimed at approximating Probability Density Functions(PDF) of random variables. But in some cases, where models are to be adapted from small sample sets of specific and locally recorded signals, instead of large but generic databases, a problem of balance between model complexity and sample size may play an important role. From this perspective, we show, through simple sound classification experiments, that constrained GMM, with fewer degrees of freedom, as compared to GMM with full covariance matrices, provide better classification performances.
