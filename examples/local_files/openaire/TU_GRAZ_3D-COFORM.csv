The goal is to obtain an accurate video-to-geometry registration to allow the bidirectional data transfer between the 3D model and the video using the perspective projection defined by the camera model. Our solution uses two different approaches: feature-based registration by KLT video tracking, and statistic-based registration by maximizing the Mutual Information (MI) between the gradient of the frame and the gradient of the rendering of the 3D model with some illumination related properties, such as surface normals and ambient occlusion. While the first approach allows a fast registration of short sequences with simple camera movements, the MI is used to correct the drift problem that KLT tracker produces over long sequences, due to the incremental tracking and the camera motion. We demonstrate, using synthetic sequences, that the alignment error obtained with our method is smaller than the one introduced by KLT, and we show the results of some interesting and challenging real sequences of objects of different sizes, acquired under different conditions.","231809","Restricted","0.1643","0.2976","10","Acquisition and mapping, Approximation from video, Aware video registration","Acquisition and mapping, Approximation from video, Aware video registration",NA,NA,NA,"",""

Alternative solutions, like the projection of a photographic dataset acquired in a different stage, are still dependent on the quality of the initial images. The short time for the acquisition campaigns and the weather conditions often force the shooting of images taken under a strong direct sun illumination. This generates colored models of poor quality. In this paper we present a method to estimate the sun position starting from a geo-referenced 3D model and a set of images. The sun position can enhance both the image alignment and color projection phases. Moreover, the detection and removal of the shadows from the images produces a better and more coherent color in the final 3D model.

Since about 10 years, systems adapted for the requirements of arts and Cultural Heritage (CH) support 3D digitization of art objects. Although the use of digital 3D models in CH is rapidly growing, many of the users are not yet completely familiar with terminology and all details of technical specifications. As most of the users are practitioners there is sometimes only little experience with terms as data quality, accuracy, resolution, measurement uncertainty, especially because these terms are used in very different ways, in manuals and brochures of scanner manufacturers as well as by authors of scientific papers. Moreover, the objective of many applications is digitization instead of measurement; therefore, many users are not even aware, that they nevertheless have to care about metrology issues such as verification and acceptance tests of the used equipment to get a reliable scanning result. In its first part, the paper will give an overview the fundamentals of data acquisition and data processing, presenting also advantages and benefits, limitations and drawbacks as well as correlations between different performance parameters of high definition 3D surface scanners. Our goal is also to rectify a number of typical misunderstandings and to clarify related terms and definitions.

Proposed for the registration of multi modal medical images, in the last years MI has been adapted to align a 3D model to a given image by using different renderings of the model and a gray-scale version of the input image. A key aspect is the choice of the rendering process to correlate the 3D model to the image without taking into account the texture data and the lighting conditions. Even if several rendering types for the 3D model have been analyzed, in some cases the alignment fails for two main reasons: the peculiar reflection behavior of the object that we are not able to reproduce in the rendering of the 3D model without knowing the material characteristics of the object and the lighting conditions of the acquisition environment; the characteristics of the image background, especially non uniform background, that can degrade the convergence of the registration. To improve the quality of the registration in these cases we propose to compute the MI between the gradient map of the 3D rendering and the gradient map of the image in order to maximize the shared data between them.","231809","Restricted","0.2954","0.2343","10","Acquisition and mapping, Approximation from video, Aware video registration","Acquisition and mapping, Approximation from video, Aware video registration",NA,NA,NA,"",""

This kind of raw data may be the result of the sampling of a real-world object by a 3D scanning device [1] or by one of the recent image-based approaches (which returns raw 3D data by processing set of images) [2] . Thanks to the improvement of the 3D scanning devices (and the development of software tools), it is now quite easy to obtain high quality, high resolution three-dimensional sampling in relatively short times. Conversely, processing this fragmented/raw data to generate a complete and usable 3D model is still a complex task, requiring the use of several algorithms and tools; the knowledge of the processing tasks and solutions required is still the realm of well-informed practitioners and it often appears as a set of obscure black boxes to most of the users. Therefore, we focus the Chapter on: (a) the geometric processing tasks that have to be applied to raw 3D scanned data to transform them into a clean and complete 3D model and, (b), how 3D scanning technology should be used for the acquisition of real artifacts. The sources of sample 3D data (i.e., the different hardware systems used in 3D scanning), are briefly presented in the following subsection. Please note that the domains of 3D scanning, geometric processing, visualization and applications to CH are too wide to provide a complete and exhaustive bibliography in a single Chapter; we decided to describe and cite here just a few, representative references to the literature. Our goal is to describe the software processing, the pitfalls of current solutions (trying to cope both with existing commercial systems and academic tools/results) and to highlight some topics of interest for future research, according to our experience and sensibility.

This is probably related to the lack in confidence in replacing consolidated approaches with experimental methods heavily based on innovative hardware or software systems. This already happened for a number of revolutionary technologies: for example, the advent of photography, color images and digital cameras took some time before changing the reference methods for archival and studies in the context of archeological excavation or of restoration actions. The same considerations hold for the use of digital 3D models in CH applications. One basic issue is the need to switch from a two-dimensional visualization and reasoning approach (essentially based on photos and drawings) to the possibility to explore and visualize the object in its full three-dimensional (3D) nature. Nevertheless, in the last few years both 3D modeling and 3D scanning have become a valued way to present and analyze CH artifacts. Several interesting practical applications have been made available to the publicly in museums, or virtually on the Web.

A real-time in-hand scanning system is enhanced by further processing its intermediate data, with the goal of producing a digital 3D model with a high quality color texture and an improved representation of the high-frequency shape detail. The proposed solution starts from the usual output of the scanner, a 3D model and a video sequence gathered by the scanner sensor, for which the rigid motion is known at each frame. The produced color texture is deprived of the typical artifacts that generally appear while creating textures from several pictures: ghosting, shadows and specular highlights. In the case of objects made of diffuse materials, the system is also able to compute a normal map, thus improving the geometry acquired by the scanner. Results demonstrate that our texturing procedure is quite fast (a few minutes to process more than a thousand images). Moreover, the method is highly automatic, since only a few intuitive parameters must be tuned by the user, and all required computations are particularly suited to GPU programming, making the method convenient and scalable to graphics hardware.","231809","Restricted","0.1224","-0.0699","2","3d scanning evices, Acceptance tests, Automatic texturing","3d scanning evices, Acceptance tests, Automatic texturing","0",NA,NA,"",""

In this context, one of the main limitations perceived by the practitioners is the uncompleteness of the sampling. Whenever we scan a complex artifact, the produced sampling usually presents a large number of unsampled regions. Many algorithmic solutions exist to close those gaps (from specific hole-filling algorithms to the drastic solution of using water-tight reconstruction methods). Unfortunately, adding patches over un-sampled regions is an issue in CH applications: if the 3D model should be used as a master document over the shape (and status) of the artwork, informed CH curators usually do not accept that an algorithm is used to {em guess} portions of a surface. In this paper, we present a low-cost setup and related algorithms to reconstruct un-sampled portions of the 3D models by inferring information about the real shape of the missing region from photographs. Data needed to drive the surface completion process are obtained by coupling a calibrated pattern of laser diodes to a digital camera. Thus, we are proposing a simple active acquisition device (based on consumer components and more flexible than standard 3D scanning devices) to improve selectively the sampling produced by a standard 3D scanning device. After acquiring one or more images with the laser-enhanced camera, an almost completely automatic process analyzes the image/s in order to extract the pattern, to estimate the laser projector intersections over the surface and determining coordinates of those points (using the consolidated triangulation approach). Then, the gathered geometric data are used to steer the hole filling in order to obtain a patch which is coherent with the real shape of the object. A series of tests on real objects proves that our method is able to recover geometrical features that cannot be reconstructed using state-of-the-art methods. Consequently, it can be used to obtain complete 3D models without creating plausible but false data.","231809","Restricted","-0.0381","-0.0673","4","3d scanning, Cultural heritage","3d scanning, Cultural heritage","2",NA,NA,"",""

By aligning archive maps to accurate modern vector data one may reduce these problems. Furthermore, the efficiency of the footprint extraction methods may be improved by aligning either modern vector data or previously extracted footprints, since common elements can be identified between maps of differing time periods and only the difference between the two needs to be extracted.

The statue, fragmented in many pieces, has undergone a complex restoration performed by a multidisciplinary working group. The contribution of digital technologies was planned from the very beginning, since the complexity of this restoration originated the design of innovative procedures for managing the reassembly and restoration process. The Madonna test bed was therefore an example of how technology innovation could be pushed by clear application needs. A first important contribution was the study of the recombination hypothesis of the fragments. This initial phase was performed on digitized 3D models of the statue fragments, with the aim of reducing fragments manipulation, preventing further damages and increasing the capabilities to rehearse and evaluate different reassembly options. The accuracy of the 3D scanned models and the new recombination procedure introduced in this paper allowed to manage this phase in the digital domain with successful results. The digital 3D models were also used to design and produce an innovative supporting structure, constructed with a rapid prototyping device. Another important contribution concerned the study and virtual restoration of the polychrome decoration of the statue; our aim was to reproduce and restore in the virtual 3D domain the very complex original polychrome decoration, on the base of the remaining traces. Consequently, new virtual painting functionalities have been designed on the MeshLab platform (an open-source tool for 3D models visualization and manipulation) for reproducing pictorial decorations over digital 3D models and have been assessed on this specific test bed. This allowed us also to investigate the complexity of the virtual repainting process and to identify further technology enhancements.

Our purpose is therefore to design a flexible interactive system, based on the selection of a set of constraints which relates different fragments, according to the understanding and experience of the CH operator. Once the user has defined those constraints, the system searches for a suitable solution, using a global energy minimization strategy that considers simultaneously all the pieces involved in the reconstruction process. Additionally, our framework provides the possibility to work in a hierarchical way, mimicking the traditional physical procedure that archaeologists use to reassemble tangible fractured objects. The frameworks is designed to work even with fragments that could have been severely damaged or eroded. On those datasets, automatic approaches may often fail, since the fractured regions do not contain enough geometric information to infer the correct matches.

In this paper we propose a novel framework for the analysis of 2D information distributed over 3D geometry, based on a locally smooth parametrization technique that allows us to treat local 3D data in terms of image content. The proposed approach has been implemented as a sketch-based system that allows to design with a few gestures a set of (possibly overlapping) parameterizations of rectangular portions of the surface. We demonstrate that, due to the locality of the parametrization, the distortion is under an acceptable threshold, while discontinuities can be avoided since the parametrized geometry is always homeomorphic to a disk.

The first step of this procedure is the alignment of the images on the 3D model. While any reconstruction pipeline aims at avoiding misregistration by improving camera calibrations and geometry, in practice a perfect alignment cannot always be reached. Depending on the way multiple camera images are fused on the object surface, remaining misregistrations show up either as ghosting or as discontinuities at transitions from one camera view to another. In this paper we propose a method, based on the computation of Optical Flow between overlapping images, to correct the local misalignment by determining the necessary displacement. The goal is to correct the symptoms of misregistration, instead of searching for a globally consistent mapping, which might not exist. The method scales up well with the size of the dataset (both photographic and geometric) and is quite independent of the characteristics of the 3D model (topology cleanliness, parametrization, density). The method is robust and can handle real world cases that have different characteristics: low level geometric details and images that lack enough features for global optimization or manual methods.

Nevertheless, especially low-end cameras integrated flash lights are considered as not reliable for high quality images, due to known artifacts (sharp shadows, highlights, uneven lighting) generated in images. Moreover, a mathematical model of this kind of light is difficult to create. In this paper we present a color correction space which, given some information about the geometry of the pictured scene, is able to provide a space-dependent color correction for each pixel of the image. The correction space can be calculated once in a lifetime using a quite fast acquisition procedure; after 3D spatial calibration, the obtained color correction function can be applied to every image where flash is the dominant light source. We developed this approach to produce better color samples in the application framework of color mapping on 3D scanned models. The correction space proposed presents several advantages: it is independent from the kind of light used (provided that it is bound to the camera), it gives the possibly to correct some artifacts (for example color deviation) introduced by flash light, and it has a wide range of possible applications, from image enhancement to material color estimation. Moreover, once that the inverse photo-to-geometry transformation is known, it allows the easy estimation of the flash light position and permits to identify and remove other annoying artifacts, like highlights and shadows. The resulting approach allows to gather in an easy manner a better and more consistent color information and to produce higher quality 3D models.","231809","Restricted","0.5017","0.0917","10","Acquisition and mapping, Approximation from video, Aware video registration","Acquisition and mapping, Approximation from video, Aware video registration","4",NA,NA,"",""

A number of recent algorithms for conversion of arbitrary meshes to regularly sampled form (typically quadrangulation) aim to align the resulting mesh with feature lines of the geometry. While resulting in a substantial improvement in mesh quality, feature alignment makes it difficult to obtain coarse regular patch partitions of the mesh. In this paper, we propose an approach to constructing patch layouts consisting of small numbers of quadrilateral patches while maintaining good feature alignment. To achieve this, we use quadrilateral T-meshes, for which the intersection of two faces may not be the whole edge or vertex, but a part of an edge. T-meshes offer more flexibility for reduction of the number of patches and vertices in a base domain while maintaining alignment with geometric features. At the same time, T-meshes retain many desirable features of quadrangulations, allowing construction of high-order representations, easy packing of regularly sampled geometric data into textures, as well as supporting different types of discretizations for physical simulation.","231809","Restricted","-0.522","0.2166","8","Abstract domains, Adaptive mesh zippering, Aligned t meshes","Abstract domains, Adaptive mesh zippering, Aligned t meshes","26",NA,NA,"",""

It consists in a pipeline that covers all steps from the digitization of the objects up to the Web publishing of the resulting digital copies. During a first stage, the digitization is performed by a high speed 3D scanner that recovers the object's geometry. A second stage then extracts from the recovered data a color texture as well as a texture of details, in order to enrich the acquired geometry in a more realistic way. Finally, a third stage converts these data so that they are compatible with the recent WebGL paradigm, then providing 3D multimedia content directly exploitable by end-users by means of standard Internet browsers. The pipeline design is centered on automation and speed, so that it can be used by non expert users to produce multimedia content from potentially large object's collections, like it may be the case in cultural heritage. The choice of a high speed scanner is particularly adapted for such a design, since this kind of devices has the advantage of being fast and intuitive. Processing stages that follow the digitization are both completely automatic and ``seamless'', in the sense that it is not incumbent upon the user to perform tasks manually, nor to use external softwares that generally need additional operations to solve compatibility issues.<br />","231809","Open Access","-0.0364","-0.5116","7","Automatic pipeline, Searching browsing viewing, Centered media linking","Automatic pipeline, Searching browsing viewing, Centered media linking","1",NA,NA,"",""

In computer graphics, for example, differences of surfaces are used for analyzing mesh processing algorithms such as mesh compression. They are also used to validate reconstruction and ﬁtting results of laser scanned surfaces. As laser scanning has become very important for the acquisition and preservation of artifacts, scanned representations are used for documentation as well as analysis of ancient objects. Detailed mesh comparisons can reveal smallest changes and damages. These analysis and documentation tasks are needed not only in the context of cultural heritage but also in engineering and manufacturing. Differences of surfaces are analyzed to check the quality of productions.

			Our contribution to this problem is a workflow, which compares a reference / nominal surface with an actual, laser-scanned data set.
			The reference surface is a procedural model whose accuracy and systematics describe the semantic properties of an object; whereas the

It is a portable and extensible system aimed to help the processing of the typical not-so-small unstructured models that arise in 3D scanning, providing a set of tools for editing, cleaning, processing, inspecting, rendering and converting meshes. The MeshLab system started in late 2005 as a part of a university course, and considerably evolved since then thanks to the effort of the Visual Computing Lab and of the support of several funded EC projects. MeshLab gained so far an excellent visibility and distribution, with several thousands downloads every month, and a continuous evolution.<br> The aim of this scanning campaign was to sample the façades of the buildings located in Piazza della Signoria (Florence, Italy). This digital 3D model was required, in the framework of a Regional Project, as a basic background model to present a complex set of images using a virtual navigation metaphor (following the PhotoSynth approach).<br> Processing of complex dataset, such as the ones produced by long range scanners, often requires specialized, difficult to use and costly software packages.

Since a complete reconstruction of the optical properties of an artifact is still hard (or impossible) to achieve, what is normally done is to rely on color data coming from photographic dataset. In this paper, we will describe the tools that MeshLab offers for the generation and processing of color information on a high-resolution 3D model. We will show the basic operations available and present actual projects were these tools have been successfully used. The availability of such advanced color management tools in an Open Source tool is an important instrument for the archeological and CH community.

In this paper we propose a new extended version of the zippering algorithm that enables the user to control the resulting mesh by introducing quality criteria in the selection of redundant data, and allows to zip together meshes with different granularity by an ad hoc refinement algorithm.","231809","Open Access","-0.2808","0.424","8","Abstract domains, Adaptive mesh zippering, Aligned t meshes","Abstract domains, Adaptive mesh zippering, Aligned t meshes","0",NA,NA,"",""
