METHODS: BP(power) and RoR were calculated from 409 ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) recordings from subjects attending a cardiovascular risk clinic. Anthropometric data, blood biochemistry, and history were recorded. The 409 subjects were 20-82 years old (average 57, SD = 13), 46% male, 9% with hypertension but not on medication and 34% on antihypertensive medication. RESULTS: Average RoR was 11.1 mmHg/hour (SD = 8) and BP(power) was 273 mmHg(2)/hour (SD = 235). Only cholesterol, low density lipoprotein and body mass index (BMI) were associated with higher BP(power) and RoR (P<0.05) from 25 variables assessed. BP(power) was lower in those taking beta-blockers or diuretics. Multivariate analysis identified that only BMI was associated with RoR (4.2% increase/unit BMI, P = 0.020) while cholesterol was the only remaining associated variable with BP(power) (17.5% increase/mmol/L cholesterol, P = 0.047). A follow up of 213 subjects with repeated ABP after an average 1.8 years identified that baseline cholesterol was the only predictor for an increasing RoR and BP(power) (P<0.05). 37 patients who commenced statin subsequently had lower BP(power) whereas 90 age and weight matched controls had similar BP(power) on follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Cholesterol is an independent predictor of a greater and more rapid rise in morning BP as well as of further increases over several years. Reduction of cholesterol with statin therapy is very effective in reducing the morning blood pressure surge.","1012881","Open Access","0.6903","-0.1076","6","Applied mathematics","Applied mathematics",4,NA,NA,"",""

Past technologies, such as ZigBee, rooted in IEEE 802.15.4, and ISO 18000-7, rooted in frame-slotted ALOHA (FSA), are based on contention medium access control (MAC) layers and have very poor performance in dense networks, thus preventing the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm from really taking off. Industrial sensing applications, such as those being deployed in oil refineries, have stringent requirements on data reliability and are being built using new standards. Despite the benefits of these new technologies, industrial shifts are not happening due to the enormous technology development and adoption costs and the fact that new standards are not well-known and completely understood. In this article, we provide a deep analysis of TSCH and D7AM, outlining operational and implementation details with the aim of facilitating the adoption of these technologies to sensor application developers.

In this kind of scenario, the network is composed of one coordinator that covers a particular area and a large number of nodes, typically hundreds or thousands, that transmit data to the coordinator upon request. Considering this scenario, in this paper we experimentally validate the energy consumption of two Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols, Frame Slotted ALOHA (FSA) and Distributed Queuing (DQ). We model both protocols as a state machine and conduct experiments to measure the average energy consumption in each state and the average number of times that a node has to be in each state in order to transmit a data packet to the coordinator. The results show that FSA is more energy efficient than DQ if the number of nodes is known a priori because the number of slots per frame can be adjusted accordingly. However, in such scenarios the number of nodes cannot be easily anticipated, leading to additional packet collisions and a higher energy consumption due to retransmissions. Contrarily, DQ does not require to know the number of nodes in advance because it is able to efficiently construct an ad hoc network schedule for each collection round. This kind of a schedule ensures that there are no packet collisions during data transmission, thus leading to an energy consumption reduction above 10% compared to FSA.
