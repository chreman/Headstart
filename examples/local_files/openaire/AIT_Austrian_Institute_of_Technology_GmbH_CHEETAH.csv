The presented work is part of a larger effort of developing a worldwide database of lifetimes that can help establishing reference baselines of stability performance for OPVs and other emerging PV technologies, which can then be utilized for pass-fail testing standards and predicting tools. The study constitutes scanning of literature articles related to stability data of OPVs, reported until mid-2015
			and collecting the reported data into a database. A generic lifetime marker is utilized for rating the stability of various
			reported devices. The collected data is combined with an earlier developed and reported database, which was based on
			articles reported until mid-2013. The extended database is utilized for establishing the baselines of lifetime for OPVs
			tested under different conditions. The work also provides the recent progress in stability of unencapsulated OPVs with
			different architectures, as well as presents the updated diagram of the reported record lifetimes of OPVs. The presented
			work is another step forward towards the development of pass-fail testing standards and lifetime prediction tools for
			emerging PV technologies.

Thus, it is important to develop proper encapsulation strategies to limit degradation. Literature on flexible DSCs lacks comparative tests with different permeation barriers, including flexible ultrahigh barriers (UHB). We designed such tests and applied UHBs to flexible DSCs for the first time. We demonstrate that UHBs double the lifetime of cells with respect to those with none or less-effective barriers. Degradation is due to a combination of electrolyte bleaching, dye detachment, and indium tin oxide (ITO) degradation. The reduced, though still noticeable, performance loss for UHB- and glass-equipped cells can be mainly ascribed to lateral permeation of gas/water, suggesting that efficient solutions for edge encapsulation must be developed to extend lifetimes further.","609788","Closed Access","0.1465","-0.5552","1","Solar cells","Solar cells","1","7","3","",""

This approach is used for the experimental validation of the main features of the optical model for multilayer glazing systems considered, through the relation between the external quantum efficiency of the module and its optical modeling. The theoretical procedure avoids the need to manufacture and characterize by solar simulator or external quantum efficiency measurements all the variety of photovoltaic module configurations, which is of interest at research and manufacturing levels, especially for building-integrated photovoltaics. The absorptivity of encapsulated solar cells is not directly accessible from direct air-bare cell or air-encapsulated cell optical measurements, and therefore analytical or numerical methods are generally needed. The calculations presented in this work provide closed analytical expressions for the layer-by-layer absorption of the different components of a photovoltaic module. From a small set of experimental measurements of a particular encapsulation configuration, and the theoretical expressions for spectral absorptivities, the short-circuit current of a module can be predicted for any other encapsulation scheme. It will be proved that the method accurately matches short-circuit current density of the modules as obtained from experimental measurements. Results will be presented for crystalline silicon and CIGS thin film cell technologies with several glass and encapsulation material combinations.

On 10??m thin absorbers, wafer-equivalent morphologies and open-circuit voltages were reached, leading to 13.2% record efficiency. However, short-circuit current densities are still limited, mainly due to optical losses at the glass-silicon interface. While nano-structures at this interface have been shown to efficiently reduce reflection, up to now these textures caused a deterioration of electronic silicon material quality. Therefore, optical gains were mitigated due to recombination losses. Here, the SMooth Anti-Reflective Three-dimensional (SMART) texture is introduced to overcome this trade-off. By smoothing nanoimprinted SiO x nano-pillar arrays with spin-coated TiO x layers, light in-coupling into laser-crystallized silicon solar cells is significantly improved as successfully demonstrated in three-dimensional simulations and in experiment. At the same time, electronic silicon material quality is equivalent to that of planar references, allowing to reach V oc values above 630?mV. Furthermore, the short-circuit current density could be increased from 21.0?mA?cm?2 for planar reference cells to 24.5?mA?cm?2 on SMART textures, a relative increase of 18%. External quantum efficiency measurements yield an increase for wavelengths up to 700?nm compared to a state-of-the-art solar cell with 11.9% efficiency, corresponding to a j sc, EQE gain of 2.8?mA?cm?2.","609788","Open Access","0.4963","0.2239","6","Article","Article","2","13","4","",""

In this study, we present the successful implementation of highly efficient light-trapping back contacts, subsequent to the passivation of Si heterojunction solar cells. The back contacts are realized by texturing an amorphous silicon layer with a refractive index close to the one of crystalline silicon at the back side of the silicon wafer. As a result, decoupling of optically active and electrically active layers is introduced. In the long run, the presented concept has the potential to improve light trapping in monolithic Si multijunction solar cells as well as solar cell configurations where texturing of the Si absorber surfaces usually results in a deterioration of the electrical properties. As part of this study, different light-trapping textures were applied to prototype silicon heterojunction solar cells. The best path length enhancement factors, at high passivation quality, were obtained with light-trapping textures based on randomly distributed craters. Comparing a planar reference solar cell with an absorber thickness of 280 μm and additional anti-reflection coating, the short-circuit current density (JSC) improves for a similar solar cell with light-trapping back contact. Due to the light trapping back contact, the JSC is enhanced around 1.8 mA cm−2 to 38.5 mA cm−2 due to light trapping in the wavelength range between 1000 nm and 1150 nm.","609788","Closed Access","0.379","-0.0065","3","Heterojunction solar cells, Light management, Planar passivation","Heterojunction solar cells, Light management, Planar passivation",NA,NA,"2","",""

These samples mostly exhibit nanoscale topographic variations, which are related to local material inhomogeneity probed either by an optical contrast or by secondary effects such as photoconductivity or photoluminescence. To date, in the interpretation and evaluation of the measurement results from a-SNOM or derived methods, often only the local material inhomogeneity is taken into account. A possible influence of the optical interaction between the scanning probe and the surface topography is rarely discussed. In this paper, we present experimental and theoretical investigation of the effects of nanoscale topographic features on a-SNOM measurement results. We conduct local photocurrent measurements on a thin-film solar cell with an a-SNOM as the illumination source. A clear correlation between the photocurrent response and local topography is observed in all measurements with a signal contrast of up to ~30%, although the sample features homogeneous permittivity and electrical properties. With the help of finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations, this correlation is reproduced and local light coupling is identified as the mechanism which determines the local photocurrent response. Our results suggest that a-SNOM-based measurements of any sample with material inhomogeneity will be superimposed by the local light-coupling effect if surface topography variation exists. This effect should always be taken into consideration for an accurate interpretation of the measurement results.","609788","Closed Access","0.2601","0.6026","7","Ddc:540","Ddc:540",NA,NA,"0","",""

The project is also tightly linked to the EERA-PV Joint Program. The CHEETAH Knowledge Exchange Area Portal (KEAP), in parallel to the project web site and other dissemination activities (newsletter, communication, etc), constitutes the pillar of the project to distribute information in a uniform and simple way. It is based on several very efficient ICT procedures by operating from the collection to management of information by dynamic data base matrix: any uploaded information is linked to all others. All interested browsers/readers can have efficient access to any stored data thanks to the utilization of a search engine/query keywords and user friendly graphic interfaces. Based on the implementation of SOPHi@webinar platform, the portal also offers its own e-learning platform.

Thin-film barriers are applied to protect the modules from degradation in humid environment. Demonstrator modules were exposed to indoor and outdoor tests to evaluate failure modes by electrochemical corrosion during operation. Test results reveal some major failure modes, but we demonstrate long lifetimes under operational conditions for certain modules without conventional encapsulation. These modules without conventional encapsulation showed less than 1% relative degradation during 1000 hours of damp-heat tests with light exposure at open circuit voltage. These promising results will guide the way to new encapsulation concepts for longer lifetimes and/or new low-cost concepts. This approach might be applied to any thin-film technology and will be an important aspect for consumer electronics with less strict requirements for very long-term operation.","609788","Open Access","-0.4624","-0.4559","2","Modules, Thin film","Modules, Thin film",NA,NA,"","",""
