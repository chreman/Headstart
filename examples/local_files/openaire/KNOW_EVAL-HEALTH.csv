Where evidence is used, it is greatly affected by cognitive and institutional features of the policy process. This paper examines the role of different types of evidence in health policy development in Nigeria. Methods The role of evidence was compared between three case studies representing different health policies, namely the (1) integrated maternal neonatal and child health strategy (IMNCH); (2) oral health (OH) policy; and (3) human resource for health (HRH) policy. The data was collected using document reviews and 31 in-depth interviews with key policy actors. Framework Approach was used to analyse the data, aided by NVivo 10 software. Results Most respondents perceived evidence to be factual and concrete to support a decision. Evidence was used more if it was perceived to be context-specific, accessible and timely. Low-cost high-impact evidence, such as the Lancet series, was reported to have been used in drafting the IMNCH policy. In the OH and HRH policies, informal evidence such as experts’ experiences and opinions, were reported to have been useful in the policy drafting stage. Both formal and informal evidence were mentioned in the HRH and OH policies, while the development of the IMNCH was revealed to have been informed mainly by more formal evidence. Overall, respondents suggested that formal evidence, such as survey reports and research publications, were most useful in the agenda-setting stage to identify the need for the policy and thus initiating the policy development process. International and local evidence were used to establish the need for a policy and develop policy, and less to develop policy implementation options. Conclusion Recognition of the value of different evidence types, combined with structures for generating and using evidence, are likely to enhance evidence-informed health policy development in Nigeria and other similar contexts.","10.1186/s12961-015-0049-0","-0.0012","-0.3027","1","Actors, Policymaking","Actors, Policymaking","",""

Guinea","2015","","","","Research Evaluation","","Impact oriented monitoring (IOM) is a novel methodology for identifying and assessing the impacts of EU-funded research projects in the area of International Public Health. A framework based on the logic and payback categories is used to categorize, into multi-dimensions, the impacts produced by public health research projects. A set of tools, including: 1) a project results framework; 2) a coordinators’ survey; 3) an end users’ survey, and 4) an assessment tool (scoring matrix), have been developed for both collecting data on results and activities and helping in assessing impacts. The need to know the impact of the projects based on robust data but, at the same time, to minimize the time and resources required of both the EC officers implementing the methodology and the project coordinators providing data on results and impacts, has led to the development of the IOM methodology. The methodology is expected to provide the DG Research and Innovation of the European Commission (EC) with usable information on how the research projects in the area of international public health are producing impacts. More importantly, this information could improve the performance of existing programmes and also form the basis for supporting research policy planning. The IOM methodology can be easily adapted to other EC-funded research areas and also implemented in other countries by institutions responsible for funding research activities.","10.1093/reseval/rvu034","-0.2891","0.453","2","","","",""

Previous attempts to develop an Oral Health Policy (OHP) to decrease the oral disease burden failed. However, a policy was eventually developed in November 2012. This paper explores the role of contextual factors, actors and the policy process in the development of the OHP and possible reasons why the current approved OHP succeeded. Methods: The study was undertaken across Nigeria; information gathered through document reviews and in-depth interviews with five groups of purposively selected respondents. Analysis of the policy development process was guided by the policy triangle framework, examining context, policy process and actors involved in the policy development. Results: The foremost enabling factor was the yearning among policy actors for a policy, having had four failed attempts. Other factors were the presence of a democratically elected government, a framework for health sector reform instituted by the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH). The approved OHP went through all stages required for policy development unlike the previous attempts. Three groups of actors played crucial roles in the process, namely academics/researchers, development partners and policy makers. They either had decision making powers or influenced policy through funding or technical ability to generate credible research evidence, all sharing a common interest in developing the OHP. Although evidence was used to inform the development of the policy, the complex interactions between the context and actors facilitated its approval. Conclusions: The OHP development succeeded through a complex inter-relationship of context, process and actors, clearly illustrating that none of these factors could have, in isolation, catalyzed the policy development. Availability of evidence is necessary but not sufficient for developing policies in this area. Wider socio-political contexts in which actors develop policy can facilitate and/or constrain actors’ roles and interests as well as policy process. These must be taken into consideration at stages of policy development in order to produce policies that will strengthen the health system, especially in low and middle-income countries, where policy processes and influences can be often less than transparent.","10.1186/s12903-015-0040-8","0.2904","-0.1503","1","Actors, Policymaking","Actors, Policymaking","",""
