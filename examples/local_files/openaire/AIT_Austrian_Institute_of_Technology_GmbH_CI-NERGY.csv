It is therefore important to accurately understand the characteristics of appliance use and to embed this understanding into predictive models to support load forecast and building design decisions. Bottom-up techniques that account for the variability in socio-demographic characteristics of the occupants and their behaviour patterns constitute a powerful tool to this end, and are potentially able to inform the design of Demand Side Management strategies in homes.\ud \ud To this end, this paper presents a comparison of alternative strategies to stochastically model the temporal energy use of low-load appliances (meaning those whose annual energy share is individually small but significant when considered as a group). In particular, discrete-time Markov processes and survival analysis have been explored. Rigorous mathematical procedures, including cluster analysis, have been employed to identify a parsimonious strategy for the modelling of variations in energy demand over time of the four principle categories of small appliances: audio-visual, computing, kitchen and other small appliances. From this it is concluded that a model of the duration for which appliances survive in discrete states expressed as bins in fraction of maximum power demand performs best. This general solution may be integrated with relative ease with dynamic simulation programs, to complement existing models of relatively large load appliances for the comprehensive simulation of household appliance use.","606851","Open Access","0.1221","0.3225","4","","",2,NA,NA,"",""

			Urban energy system planning (UESP) is a topic of growing concern for cities in deregulated energy markets, which plan to decrease energy demand, reduce their dependency on fossil fuels, and increase the share of renewable energy sources. UESP being a highly multisectoral and multi-actor task, multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods are frequently used in the decision processes. These methods may provide support in organizing and identifying solutions to problems with conflicting objectives. However, knowing which method to use is generally not straightforward, as the appropriateness of a method or combination of methods depends on the decision problem’s context. Therefore, this article reviewed scientific papers to characterize and analyze MCDA problems and methods in the context of UESP. The review systematically explores issues such as the scope of the problems, the alternatives and criteria considered, the expected decision outcomes, the decision analysis methods and the rationales for selecting and combining them, and the role of values in driving the decision problems. The final outcome is a synthesis of the data and insights obtained, which may help potential users identify appropriate decision analysis methods based on given problem characteristics.

Taking advantage of this trend, urban energy domain have developed several compute intensive physical and data driven models. These models are used in various distinct simulation softwares to simulate the whole life-cycle of energy flow in cities from supply, distribution, conversion, storage and consumption. Since some simulation software target a specific energy system, it is necessary to integrate them to predict present and future urban energy needs. However, a key drawback is that, these tools are not compatible with each other as they use custom or propriety formats. Furthermore, they are designed as desktop applications and cannot be easily integrated with third-party tools (open source or commercial). Thereby, missing out on potential model functionalities which are required for sustainable urban energy management. In this paper, we propose a solution based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). Our approach relies on open interfaces to offer flexible integration of modelling and computational functionality as loosely coupled distributed services.","606851","Open Access","0.1546","-0.3228","6","Ta1-2040","Ta1-2040",0,NA,NA,"",""

Thus allowing to perform city scale simulations using simplified thermal energy balance models. However, the uncertainty inherent in datasets and the reliability of their data sources are often not given due consideration. Such consideration to the uncertainty problem would need a paradigm shift in simulation practices from a single value assignment to uncertainty characterization followed by assessment of qualitative and quantitative impact on the simulation results. The proposed study establishes a mechanism to handle the uncertainty arising from the building geometry reconstruction process and its possible consequences on the thermal energy demand calculations.","606851","Open Access","0.5073","-0.0924","5","Ta1-2040","Ta1-2040",0,NA,NA,"",""
