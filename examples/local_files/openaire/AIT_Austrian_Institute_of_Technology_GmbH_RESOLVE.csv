Notably, these age-related alterations contribute to distinct pathophysiological characteristics depending on the tissue of origin and function and thus require special attention in a type by type manner. In this paper, we review the current understanding of the mechanisms leading to tissue-specific adult stem cell dysfunction and reduced regenerative capacity with age. A comprehensive investigation of the hematopoietic, the neural, the mesenchymal, and the skeletal stem cells in age-related research highlights that distinct mechanisms are associated with the different types of tissue stem cells. The link between age-related stem cell dysfunction and human pathologies is discussed along with the challenges and the future perspectives in stem cell-based therapies in age-related diseases.","317146","Open Access","0.4189","-0.1291","14","Induced pluripotent stem, Pluripotent stem cells, Sleeping beauty transposon","Induced pluripotent stem, Pluripotent stem cells, Sleeping beauty transposon",19,"39","2","",""

			        Embryoid body (EB) formation is a common intermediate during in vitro differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into specialized cell types. We have optimized the slow-turning, lateral vessel (STLV) for large scale and homogenous EB production from mouse embryonic stem cells. The effects of inoculating different cell numbers, time of EB adherence to gelatin-coated dishes, and rotation speed for optimal EB formation and cardiac differentiation were investigated. Using 3 ? 105 cells/ml, 10 rpm rotary speed and plating of EBs onto gelatin-coated surfaces three days after culture, were the best parameters for optimal size and EB quality on consequent cardiac differentiation. These optimized parameters enrich cardiac differentiation in ES cells when using the STLV method.

Despite its heritability of 25–32 %, the genetic background of longevity is as yet largely unexplained. Apart from APOE status, variation in the FOXO3A gene is the only confirmed genetic contributor to survival into old age. On the other hand, FOXO3A activity is known to be downregulated in various cancers, and the gene was recently identified as a novel deletion hotspot in human lung adenocarcinoma. In view of the strong association between smoking and lung cancer, we set out to explore whether smoking modifies the known association between FOXO3A variation and longevity. To this end, we conducted a case–control study in two different populations, drawing upon extensive collections of old-aged individuals and younger controls available to us (1,613 German centenarians/nonagenarians and 1,104 controls; 1,088 Danish nonagenarians and 736 controls). In the German sample, 21 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the FOXO3A gene region were genotyped, whereas 15 FOXO3A SNPs were analyzed in the Danish sample. Eight SNPs were typed in both populations. Logistic regression analysis revealed that adjustment for smoking does not systematically alter the association between FOXO3A variation and longevity in neither population. Our analysis therefore suggests that the said association is not largely due to the confounding effects of lung cancer.","202047","Open Access","0.0658","-0.6101","3","Human longevity, Association study, Case control","Human longevity, Association study, Case control",4,"9","2","",""

Indeed, the Gadd45 proteins stand at the crossroad of the cell fates by controlling the balance between cell (DNA) repair, eliminating (apoptosis) or preventing the expansion of potentially dangerous cells (cell cycle arrest, cellular senescence), and maintaining the stem cell pool. However, the biogerontological aspects have not thus far received sufficient attention. Here we analyzed the pathways and modes of action by which Gadd45 members are involved in aging, longevity and age-related diseases. Because of their pleiotropic action, a decreased inducibility of Gadd45 members may have far-reaching consequences including genome instability, accumulation of DNA damage, and disorders in cellular homeostasis – all of which may eventually contribute to the aging process and age-related disorders (promotion of tumorigenesis, immune disorders, insulin resistance and reduced responsiveness to stress). Most recently, the dGadd45 gene has been identified as a longevity regulator in Drosophila. Although further wide-scale research is warranted, it is becoming increasingly clear that Gadd45s are highly relevant to aging, age-related diseases (ARDs) and to the control of life span, suggesting them as potential therapeutic targets in ARDs and pro-longevity interventions.","202047","Open Access","0.3272","-0.3439","1","Age related diseases, Longevity and age, Ageing genomic resources","Age related diseases, Longevity and age, Ageing genomic resources",53,"65",NA,"",""

Candidate markers were identified by bisulfite conversion-based genome-wide methylation screening of lung tissue from lung cancer, fibrotic ILD, and COPD. cfDNA from 400 μl serum (n = 204) served to test the diagnostic performance of these markers. Following methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion and enrichment of methylated DNA via targeted amplification (multiplexed MSRE enrichment), a total of 96 markers were addressed by highly parallel qPCR. Lung cancer was efficiently separated from non-cancer and controls with a sensitivity of 87.8%, (95%CI: 0.67–0.97) and specificity 90.2%, (95%CI: 0.65–0.98). Cancer was distinguished from ILD with a specificity of 88%, (95%CI: 0.57–1), and COPD from cancer with a specificity of 88% (95%CI: 0.64–0.97). Separation of ILD from COPD and controls was possible with a sensitivity of 63.1% (95%CI: 0.4–0.78) and a specificity of 70% (95%CI: 0.54–0.81). The results were confirmed using an independent sample set (n = 46) by use of the four top markers discovered in the study (HOXD10, PAX9, PTPRN2, and STAG3) yielding an AUC of 0.85 (95%CI: 0.72–0.95). This technique was capable of distinguishing interrelated complex pulmonary diseases suggesting that multiplexed MSRE enrichment might be useful for simple and reliable diagnosis of diverse multifactorial disease states.","202047","Open Access","0.6148","0.384","6","Serum autoantibody testing, Based dna isolation, Dna methylation","Serum autoantibody testing, Based dna isolation, Dna methylation",16,"57","5","",""

The metastatic cascade represents a multi-step process which includes local tumor cell invasion, entry into the vasculature followed by the exit of carcinoma cells from the circulation and colonization at the distal sites. At the earliest stage of successful cancer cell dissemination, the primary cancer adapts the secondary site of tumor colonization involving the tumor–stroma crosstalk. The migration and plasticity of cancer cells as well as the surrounding environment such as stromal and endothelial cells are mandatory. Consequently, the mechanisms of cell movement are of utmost relevance for targeted intervention of which three different types have been reported. Tumor cells can migrate either collectively, in a mesenchymal or in an amoeboid type of movement and intravasate the blood or lymph vasculature. Intravasation by the interaction of tumor cells with the vascular endothelium is mechanistically poorly understood. Changes in the epithelial plasticity enable carcinoma cells to switch between these types of motility. The types of migration may change depending on the intervention thereby increasing the velocity and aggressiveness of invading cancer cells. Interference with collective or mesenchymal cell invasion by targeting integrin expression or metalloproteinase activity, respectively, resulted in an amoeboid cell phenotype as the ultimate exit strategy of cancer cells. There are little mechanistic details reported in vivo showing that the amoeboid behavior can be either reversed or efficiently inhibited. Future concepts of metastasis intervention must simultaneously address the collective, mesenchymal and amoeboid mechanisms of cell invasion in order to advance in anti-metastatic strategies as these different types of movement can coexist and cooperate. Beyond the targeting of cell movements, the adhesion of cancer cells to the stroma in heterotypic circulating tumor cell emboli is of paramount relevance for anti-metastatic therapy.","202047","Open Access","0.5443","0.0326","12","Cell tumors, Differentiation of mouse, Embryonic stem cells","Cell tumors, Differentiation of mouse, Embryonic stem cells",148,"433",NA,"",""

Little is known about the mechanisms of bulky cancer invasion into lymph ducts. Methods: To particularly address this issue, we developed a 3-dimensional co-culture model involving MCF-7 breast cancer cell spheroids and telomerase-immortalised human lymphendothelial cell (LEC) monolayers, which resembles intravasation in vivo and correlated the malignant phenotype with specific protein expression of LECs. Results: We show that tumour spheroids generate ‘circular chemorepellent-induced defects' (CCID) in LEC monolayers through retraction of LECs, which was induced by 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) secreted by MCF-7 spheroids. This 12(S)-HETE-regulated retraction of LECs during intravasation particularly allowed us to investigate the key regulators involved in the motility and plasticity of LECs. In all, 12(S)-HETE induced pro-metastatic protein expression patterns and showed NF-κB-dependent up-regulation of the mesenchymal marker protein S100A4 and of transcriptional repressor ZEB1 concomittant with down-regulation of the endothelial adherence junction component VE-cadherin. This was in accordance with ∼50% attenuation of CCID formation by treatment of cells with 10 μ Bay11-7082. Notably, 12(S)-HETE-induced VE-cadherin repression was regulated by either NF-κB or by ZEB1 since ZEB1 siRNA knockdown abrogated not only 12(S)-HETE-mediated VE-cadherin repression but inhibited VE-cadherin expression in general. Interpretation: These data suggest an endothelial to mesenchymal transition-like process of LECs, which induces single cell motility during endothelial transmigration of breast carcinoma cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the 12(S)-HETE-induced intravasation of MCF-7 spheroids through LECs require an NF-κB-dependent process of LECs triggering the disintegration of cell–cell contacts, migration, and the generation of CCID.","202047","Open Access","0.6103","-0.0626","15","Breast cancer, Translational therapeutics","Breast cancer, Translational therapeutics",34,"32",NA,"",""

The major emphasis of research focuses currently on the molecular biology of tumour cells, while still little is known regarding the contribution of lymphatics. Methods: Breast cancer cell spheroids attached to lymphendothelial cell (LEC) monolayers were used to investigate the process of intravasation by measuring the areas of ‘circular chemorepellent-induced defects' (CCID), which can be considered as entry gates for bulky tumour intravasation. Aspects of tumour cell intravasation were furthermore studied by adhesion assay, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Replacing cancer spheroids with the CCID-triggering compound 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) facilitated western blot analyses of Bay11-7082- and baicalein-treated LECs. Results: Binding of LECs to MCF-7 spheroids, which is a prerequisite for CCID formation, was mediated by ICAM-1 expression, and this depended on NF-κB and correlated with the expression of the prometastatic factor S100A4. Simultaneous inhibition of NF-κB with Bay11-7082 and of arachidonate lipoxygenase (ALOX)-15 with baicalein prevented CCID formation additively. Conclusion: Two mechanisms contribute to CCID formation: ALOX15 via the generation of 12(S)-HETE by MCF-7 cells, which induces directional migration of LECs, and ICAM-1 in LECs under control of NF-κB, which facilitates adhesion of MCF-7 cells to LECs.","P 19598","Open Access","0.6819","-0.0956","15","Breast cancer, Translational therapeutics","Breast cancer, Translational therapeutics",23,NA,NA,"",""

Some approved pharmaceuticals exhibit activities against diseases they have not been developed for. In order to discover such activities that might attenuate lymph node metastasis, we investigated 225 drugs, which are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Methods: A three-dimensional cell co-culture assay was utilised measuring tumour cell-induced disintegrations of the lymphendothelial wall through which tumour emboli can intravasate as a limiting step in lymph node metastasis of ductal breast cancer. The disintegrated areas in the lymphendothelial cell (LEC) monolayers were induced by 12(S)-HETE, which is secreted by MCF-7 tumour cell spheroids, and are called ‘circular chemorepellent induced defects' (CCIDs). The putative mechanisms by which active drugs prevented the formation of entry gates were investigated by western blotting, NF-κB activity assay and by the determination of 12(S)-HETE synthesis. Results: Acetohexamide, nifedipin, isoxsuprine and proadifen dose dependently inhibited the formation of CCIDs in LEC monolayers and inhibited markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition and migration. The migration of LECs is a prerequisite of CCID formation, and these drugs either repressed paxillin levels or the activities of myosin light chain 2, or myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase. Isoxsuprine inhibited all three migration markers, and isoxsuprine and acetohexamide suppressed the synthesis of 12(S)-HETE, whereas proadifen and nifedipin inhibited NF-κB activation. Both the signalling pathways independently cause CCID formation. Conclusion: The targeting of different mechanisms was most likely the reason for synergistic effects of different drug combinations on the inhibition of CCID formation. Furthermore, the treatment with drug combinations allowed also a several-fold reduction in drug concentrations. These results encourage further screening of approved drugs and their in vivo testing.","202047","Open Access","0.7513","-0.0136","15","Breast cancer, Translational therapeutics","Breast cancer, Translational therapeutics",17,NA,NA,"",""

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the progression of malignant hepatocytes frequently depends on transforming growth factor (TGF)-β provided by stromal cells. TGF-β induces an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of oncogenic Ras-transformed hepatocytes and an upregulation of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling. To analyse the influence of the hepatic tumor–stroma crosstalk onto tumor growth and progression, we co-injected malignant hepatocytes and myofibroblasts (MFBs). For this, we either used in vitro-activated p19ARF MFBs or in vivo-activated MFBs derived from physiologically inflamed livers of Mdr2/p19ARF double-null mice. We show that co-transplantation of MFBs with Ras-transformed hepatocytes strongly enhances tumor growth. Genetic interference with the PDGF signaling decreases tumor cell growth and maintains plasma membrane-located E-cadherin and β-catenin at the tumor–host border, indicating a blockade of hepatocellular EMT. We further generated a collagen gel-based three dimensional HCC model in vitro to monitor the MFB-induced invasion of micro-organoid HCC spheroids. This invasion was diminished after inhibition of TGF-β or PDGF signaling. These data suggest that the TGF-β/PDGF axis is crucial during hepatic tumor–stroma crosstalk, regulating both tumor growth and cancer progression.","P 19598","Open Access","0.3797","0.2266","12","Cell tumors, Differentiation of mouse, Embryonic stem cells","Cell tumors, Differentiation of mouse, Embryonic stem cells",91,NA,NA,"",""

EBs mimic early embryonic development and are commonly produced for cardiomyogenesis. Here, we describe a method of EB formation in hydrodynamic conditions using a slow-turning lateral vessel (STLV) bioreactor and the subsequent differentiation of EBs into cardiomyocytes. EBs formed in the STLV were compared with conventional techniques, such as hanging drop (HD) or static suspension cell culture (SSC), for homogeneity of EB size, shape, proliferation, apoptosis, and in vitro cardiac differentiation. After 3 days of culture, a four-fold improvement in the yield of EB formation/mL, a six-fold enhancement in total yield of EB/mL, and a nearly 10-fold reduction of cells that failed to incorporate into EBs were achieved in STLV versus SSC. During cardiac differentiation, a 1.5- to 4.2-fold increase in the area of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) per single EB in STLV versus SSC and HD was achieved. These results demonstrate that the STLV method improves the quality and quantity of ES cells to form EBs and enhances the efficiency of cardiac differentiation. We have demonstrated that the mechanical method of cell differentiation creates different microenvironments for the cells and thus influences their lineage commitments, even when genetic origin and the culture medium are the same. Ascorbic acid (ASC) improved further cardiac commitment in differentiation assays. Hence, this culture system is suitable for the production of large numbers of cells for clinical cell replacement therapies and industrial drug testing applications.","218205","Open Access","0.5947","0.1225","12","Cell tumors, Differentiation of mouse, Embryonic stem cells","Cell tumors, Differentiation of mouse, Embryonic stem cells",3,NA,NA,"",""

			The genetic contribution to the variation in human lifespan is ∼ 25%. Despite the large number of identified disease-susceptibility loci, it is not known which loci influence population mortality. We performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 7729 long-lived individuals of European descent (≥ 85 years) and 16 121 younger controls (<65 years) followed by replication in an additional set of 13 060 long-lived individuals and 61 156 controls. In addition, we performed a subset analysis in cases aged ≥ 90 years. We observed genome-wide significant association with longevity, as reflected by survival to ages beyond 90 years, at a novel locus, rs2149954, on chromosome 5q33.3 (OR = 1.10, P = 1.74 × 10(-8)). We also confirmed association of rs4420638 on chromosome 19q13.32 (OR = 0.72, P = 3.40 × 10(-36)), representing the TOMM40/APOE/APOC1 locus. In a prospective meta-analysis (n = 34 103), the minor allele of rs2149954 (T) on chromosome 5q33.3 associates with increased survival (HR = 0.95, P = 0.003). This allele has previously been reported to associate with low blood pressure in middle age. Interestingly, the minor allele (T) associates with decreased cardiovascular mortality risk, independent of blood pressure. We report on the first GWAS-identified longevity locus on chromosome 5q33.3 influencing survival in the general European population. The minor allele of this locus associates with low blood pressure in middle age, although the contribution of this allele to survival may be less dependent on blood pressure. Hence, the pleiotropic mechanisms by which this intragenic variation contributes to lifespan regulation have to be elucidated.","084762","Open Access","-0.1456","-0.7392","3","Human longevity, Association study, Case control","Human longevity, Association study, Case control",78,"131","14","",""

To assist basic research on ageing, we developed the Human Ageing Genomic Resources (HAGR). This work provides an overview of the databases and tools in HAGR and describes how the gerontology research community can employ them. Several recent changes and improvements to HAGR are also presented. The two centrepieces in HAGR are GenAge and AnAge. GenAge is a gene database featuring genes associated with ageing and longevity in model organisms, a curated database of genes potentially associated with human ageing, and a list of genes tested for their association with human longevity. A myriad of biological data and information is included for hundreds of genes, making GenAge a reference for research that reflects our current understanding of the genetic basis of ageing. GenAge can also serve as a platform for the systems biology of ageing, and tools for the visualization of protein-protein interactions are also included. AnAge is a database of ageing in animals, featuring over 4,000 species, primarily assembled as a resource for comparative and evolutionary studies of ageing. Longevity records, developmental and reproductive traits, taxonomic information, basic metabolic characteristics, and key observations related to ageing are included in AnAge. Software is also available to aid researchers in the form of Perl modules to automate numerous tasks and as an SPSS script to analyse demographic mortality data.

Since the development of first iPSCs, tremendous effort has been directed to the development of methods to increase the efficiency of the process and to reduce the extent of genomic modifications associated with the reprogramming procedure. The established lineage-specific differentiation protocols developed for ESCs are being applied to iPSCs, as they have great potential in regenerative medicine for cell therapy, disease modeling either for drug development or for fundamental science, and, last but not least, toxicity testing.

Mechanisms of the hepatic xenobiotic metabolism are mostly involved in providing chemoresistance to therapeutic compounds. Given the fact that the aberrant activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) is frequently observed in hepatocellular carcinomas, we focused on the efficacy of the novel compounds BA-12 and BP-14 that antagonize CDK1/2/5/7 and CDK9. Inhibition of those CDKs in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines reduced the clonogenicity by arresting cells in S-G(2) and G(2)-M phase of the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis. In contrast, primary human hepatocytes failed to show cytotoxicity and apoptosis. No loss of chemosensitivity was observed in hepatocellular carcinoma cells after long-term exposure to inhibitors. In vivo, treatment of xenografted human hepatocellular carcinomas with BA-12 or BP-14 effectively repressed tumor formation. Moreover, BA-12 or BP-14 significantly diminished diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatoma development in mice. These data show that BA-12 or BP-14 exhibit strong antitumorigenic effects in the absence of chemoresistance, resulting in a superior efficacy compared with currently used chemotherapeutics in hepatocellular carcinomas.","P 20905","Open Access","0.2616","0.0942","7","Hepatocellular carcinoma, Mesenchymal transition, Arf controls","Hepatocellular carcinoma, Mesenchymal transition, Arf controls",7,NA,NA,"",""

Here, we studied the following: (1) the impact of p75(NTR) in the healing of ischemic and diabetic calf wounds; (2) the link between p75(NTR) and ST2; and (3) circulating sST2 levels in critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients.</p><p>Methods and Results-Diabetes mellitus was induced in p75(NTR) knockout (p75KO) mice and wild-type (WT) littermates by streptozotocin. Diabetic and nondiabetic p75KO and WT mice received left limb ischemia induction and a full-thickness wound on the ipsilateral calf. Diabetes mellitus impaired wound closure and angiogenesis and increased ST2 expression in WT, but not in p75KO wounds. In cultured endothelial cells, p75(NTR) promoted ST2 (both isoforms) expression through p38(MAPK)/activating transcription factor 2 pathway activation. Next, sST2 was measured in the serum of patients with CLI undergoing either revascularization or limb amputation and in the 2 nondiabetic groups (with CLI or nonischemic individuals).

Streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice underwent bilateral limb ischemia and wounding. One wound was covered with collagen containing 2×104 CD133+ or CD133− cells or vehicle. The contralateral wound, covered with only collagen, served as control. Fetal CD133+ cells expressed high levels of wingless (Wnt) genes, which were downregulated following differentiation into CD133− cells along with upregulation of Wnt antagonists secreted frizzled-related protein (sFRP)-1, -3, and -4. CD133+ cells accelerated wound closure as compared with CD133− or vehicle and promoted angiogenesis through stimulation of endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and survival by paracrine effects. CD133+ cells secreted high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A and interleukin (IL)-8. Consistently, CD133+ CCM accelerated wound closure and reparative angiogenesis, with this action abrogated by coadministering the Wnt antagonist sFRP-1 or neutralizing antibodies against VEGF-A or IL-8. In vitro, these effects were recapitulated following exposure of high-glucose-primed human umbilical vein endothelial cells to CD133+ CCM, resulting in stimulation of migration, angiogenesis-like network formation and induction of Wnt expression.

The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) describes the transformation of well-differentiated epithelial cells to a de-differentiated phenotype and plays a central role in the invasion and intrahepatic metastasis of HCC cells. Modulation of the transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?) signaling is known to induce various tumor-promoting and EMT-inducing pathways in HCC. The meta-analysis of a panel of EMT gene expression studies revealed that neuropilin 2 (NRP2) is significantly upregulated in cells that have undergone EMT induced by TGF-?. In this study we assessed the functional role of NRP2 in epithelial and mesenchymal-like HCC cells and focused on the molecular interplay between NRP2 and TGF-?/Smad signaling. Methods NRP2 expression was analyzed in human HCC cell lines and tissue arrays comprising 133 HCC samples. Cell migration was examined by wound healing and Transwell assays in the presence and absence of siRNA against NRP2. NRP2 and TGF-? signaling were analyzed by Western blotting and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Results We show that NRP2 is particularly expressed in HCC cell lines with a dedifferentiated, mesenchymal-like phenotype. NRP2 expression is upregulated by the canonical TGF-?/Smad signaling while NRP2 expression has no impact on TGF-? signaling in HCC cells. Reduced expression of NRP2 by knock-down or inhibition of TGF-? signaling resulted in diminished cell migration independently of each other, suggesting that NRP2 fails to collaborate with TGF-? signaling in cell movement. In accordance with these data, elevated levels of NRP2 correlated with a higher tumor grade and less differentiation in a large collection of human HCC specimens. Conclusions These data suggest that NRP2 associates with a less differentiated, mesenchymal-like HCC phenotype and that NRP2 plays an important role in tumor cell migration upon TGF-?-dependent HCC progression.

However, the exact mechanisms that contribute to the initial production of precursor IL-1? (pro-IL-1?) are still unclear. Here, we assessed the implication of alarmins (IL-1?, IL-33 and HMGB1) in the lung response to silica particles and found that IL-1? is a master cytokine that regulates IL-1? expression. Methods Pro- and mature IL-1? as well as alarmins were assessed by ELISA, Western Blot or qRT-PCR in macrophage cultures and in mouse lung following nano- and micrometric silica exposure. Implication of these immune mediators in the establishment of lung inflammatory responses to silica was investigated in knock-out mice or after antibody blockade by evaluating pulmonary neutrophil counts, CXCR2 expression and degree of histological injury. Results We found that the early release of IL-1? and IL-33, but not HMGB1 in alveolar space preceded the lung expression of pro-IL-1? and neutrophilic inflammation in silica-treated mice. In vitro, the production of pro-IL-1? by alveolar macrophages was significantly induced by recombinant IL-1? but not by IL-33. Neutralization or deletion of IL-1? reduced IL-1? production and neutrophil accumulation after silica in mice. Finally, IL-1? released by J774 macrophages after in vitro exposure to a range of micro- and nanoparticles of silica was correlated with the degree of lung inflammation induced in vivo by these particles. Conclusions We demonstrated that in response to silica exposure, IL-1? is rapidly released from pre-existing stocks in alveolar macrophages and promotes subsequent lung inflammation through the stimulation of IL-1? production. Moreover, we demonstrated that in vitro IL-1? release from macrophages can be used to predict the acute inflammogenic activity of silica micro- and nanoparticles.

Here we show that carcinogenic CNT induce an early and sustained immunosuppressive response characterized by the accumulation of monocytic Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (M-MDSC) that counteract effective immune surveillance of tumor cells. Methods Wistar rats and C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with carcinogenic multi-walled Mitsui-7 CNT (CNT-7) or crocidolite asbestos. Peritoneal mesothelioma development and immune cell accumulation were assessed until 12?months. Leukocyte sub-populations were identified by recording expression of CD11b/c and His48 by flow cytometry. The immunosuppressive activity on T lymphocytes of purified peritoneal leukocytes was assessed in a co-culture assay with activated spleen cells. Results We demonstrate that long and short mesotheliomagenic CNT-7 injected in the peritoneal cavity of rats induced, like asbestos, an early and selective accumulation of monocytic cells (CD11b/cint and His48hi) which possess the ability to suppress polyclonal activation of T lymphocytes and correspond to M-MDSC. Peritoneal M-MDSC persisted during the development of peritoneal mesothelioma in CNT-7-treated rats but were only transiently recruited after non-carcinogenic CNT (CNT-M, CNT-T) injection. Peritoneal M-MDSC did not accumulate in mice which are resistant to mesothelioma development. Conclusions Our data provide new insights into the initial pathogenic events induced by CNT, adding a new component to the adverse outcome pathway leading to mesothelioma development. The specificity of the M-MDSC response after carcinogenic CNT exposure highlights the interest of this response for detecting the ability of new nanomaterials to cause cancer.

Our comprehensive data mining revealed over 250 genes tightly associated with CS. Using systems biology tools, we found that CS is closely interconnected with aging, longevity and ARDs, either by sharing common genes and regulators or by protein-protein interactions and eventually by common signaling pathways. The most enriched pathways across CS, ARDs and aging-associated conditions (oxidative stress and chronic inflammation) are growth-promoting pathways and the pathways responsible for cell-extracellular matrix interactions and stress response. Of note, the patterns of evolutionary conservation of CS and cancer genes showed a high degree of similarity, suggesting the co-evolution of these two phenomena. Moreover, cancer genes and microRNAs seem to stand at the crossroad between CS and ARDs. Our analysis also provides the basis for new predictions: the genes common to both cancer and other ARD(s) are highly likely candidates to be involved in CS and vice versa. Altogether, this study shows that there are multiple links between CS, aging, longevity and ARDs, suggesting a common molecular basis for all these conditions. Modulating CS may represent a potential pro-longevity and anti-ARDs therapeutic strategy.","202047","Open Access","-0.0637","-0.3042","1","Age related diseases, Longevity and age, Ageing genomic resources","Age related diseases, Longevity and age, Ageing genomic resources",387,"292","1","",""

Two different mice models that develop spontaneous fibrosis (Mdr2(-/-)/p19(ARF-/-), Stat3(Δhc)/Mdr2(-/-)) and a model of experimental induced fibrosis (CCl(4)) were used. In addition, gene expression in biopsies from chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients or non-fibrotic liver samples was analyzed. Results have indicated that NOX4 expression was increased in the livers of all animal models, concomitantly with fibrosis development and TGF-β pathway activation. In vitro TGF-β-treated HSC increased NOX4 expression correlating with transdifferentiation to MFBs. Knockdown experiments revealed that NOX4 downstream TGF-β is necessary for HSC activation as well as for the maintenance of the MFB phenotype. NOX4 was not necessary for TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), but was required for TGF-β-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes. Finally, NOX4 expression was elevated in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-derived fibrosis, increasing along the fibrosis degree. In summary, fibrosis progression both in vitro and in vivo (animal models and patients) is accompanied by increased NOX4 expression, which mediates acquisition and maintenance of the MFB phenotype, as well as TGF-β-induced death of hepatocytes.","202047","Open Access","0.1894","0.2721","5","Lung fibrosis, Lung inflammation, Acid inhibits","Lung fibrosis, Lung inflammation, Acid inhibits",56,"39",NA,"",""

False versus true 3q chromosomal amplification in squamous cell lung carcinoma may have tremendous impact on trials involving drugs which target DNA zones mapping on 3q. Forty squamous lung carcinomas were analyzed by FISH to assess chromosome 3q amplification. aCGH was performed as gold-standard to avoid false positive amplifications. Three clustered patterns of fluorescent signals were observed. Eight cases out of 40 (20%) showed ≥8 3q signals. Twenty out of 40 (50%) showed from 3 to 7 signals.

EMT is the conversion of carcinoma cells from an epithelial to a mesenchymal phenotype that associates with a higher cell motility as well as enhanced chemoresistance and cancer stemness. Notably, EMT has been increasingly recognized as an early event of metastasis. Numerous gene expression studies (GES) have been conducted to obtain transcriptome signatures and marker genes to understand the regulatory mechanisms underlying EMT. Yet, no meta-analysis considering the multitude of GES of EMT has been performed to comprehensively elaborate the core genes in this process. Here we report the meta-analysis of 18 independent and published GES of EMT which focused on different cell types and treatment modalities. Computational analysis revealed clustering of GES according to the type of treatment rather than to cell type. GES of EMT induced via transforming growth factor-β and tumor necrosis factor-α treatment yielded uniformly defined clusters while GES of models with alternative EMT induction clustered in a more complex fashion. In addition, we identified those up- and downregulated genes which were shared between the multitude of GES. This core gene list includes well known EMT markers as well as novel genes so far not described in this process. Furthermore, several genes of the EMT-core gene list significantly correlated with impaired pathological complete response in breast cancer patients.

We evaluated inflammatory and fibrosis responses to bleomycin in F508del homozygous and wild-type mice, and phenotype of fibroblasts explanted from mouse lungs and skin. The effect of vardenafil, a cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, was tested in vivo and in culture. Responses of proinflammatory and fibrotic markers to bleomycin were enhanced in lungs and skin of CF mice and were prevented by treatment with vardenafil. Purified lung and skin fibroblasts from CF mice proliferated and differentiated into myofibroblasts more prominently and displayed higher sensitivity to growth factors than those recovered from wild-type littermates. Under inflammatory stimulation, mRNA and protein expression of proinflammatory mediators were higher in CF than in wild-type fibroblasts, in which CFTR expression reached similar levels to those observed in other non-epithelial cells, such as macrophages.

The complement component C4 with the isotypes C4A and C4B is an effector protein of the immune system, and differences in the overall C4 copy number or gene size (long C4L; short C4S) may influence the strength of the immune response and disease susceptibilities. Previously, an association between C4B copy number and life span was reported for Hungarians and Icelanders, where the C4B*Q0 genotype, which is defined by C4B gene deficiency, showed a decrease in frequency with age. Additionally, one of the studies indicated that a low C4B copy number might be a genetic trait that is manifested only in the presence of the environmental risk factor \"smoking\". These observations prompted us to investigate the role of the C4 alleles in our large German longevity sample (∼ 700 cases; 94-110 years and ∼ 900 younger controls). No significant differences in the number of C4A, C4B and C4S were detected. Besides, the C4B*Q0 carrier state did not decrease with age, irrespective of smoking as an interacting variable. However, for C4L*Q0 a significantly different carrier frequency was observed in the cases compared with controls (cases: 5.08%; controls: 9.12%; p = 0.003). In a replication sample of 714 German cases (91-108 years) and 890 controls this result was not replicated (p = 0.14) although a similar trend of decreased C4L*Q0 carrier frequency in cases was visible (cases: 7.84%; controls: 10.00%).","202047","Open Access","-0.106","-0.6612","3","Human longevity, Association study, Case control","Human longevity, Association study, Case control",6,"17","1","",""

In this study, we examined the lung inflammatory and fibrotic responses to silica in MyD88-knockout (KO) mice. In comparison to wild-type (WT) mice, we found that MyD88-KO animals developed attenuated lung inflammation, neutrophil accumulation and IL-1β release in response to silica. Granuloma formation was also less pronounced in MyD88-KO mice after silica. This limited inflammatory response was not accompanied by a concomitant attenuation of lung collagen accumulation after silica. Histological analyses revealed that while pulmonary fibrosis was localized in granulomas in WT animals, it was diffusely distributed throughout the parenchyma in MyD88-KO mice. Robust collagen accumulation was also observed in mice KO for several other components of innate immunity (IL-1R, IL-1, ASC, NALP3, IL-18R, IL-33R, TRIF, and TLR2-3-4,). We additionally show that pulmonary fibrosis in MyD88-KO mice was associated with the accumulation of pro-fibrotic regulatory T lymphocytes (T regs) and pro-fibrotic cytokine expression (TGF-β, IL-10 and PDGF-B), not with T helper (Th) 17 cell influx. Our findings indicate that the activation of MyD88-related innate immunity is central in the establishment of particle-induced lung inflammatory and granuloma responses. The development of lung fibrosis appears uncoupled from inflammation and may be orchestrated by a T reg-associated pathway.","202047","Open Access","0.2478","0.5715","5","Lung fibrosis, Lung inflammation, Acid inhibits","Lung fibrosis, Lung inflammation, Acid inhibits",11,NA,NA,"",""

Such comparison highlighted the need to include additional regulatory connections in order to obtain the fixed point attractors of the model associated with the five known progenitor cell types located in the ventral spinal cord. The revised gene regulatory network reproduced previously observed cell state switches between progenitor cells observed in knock-out animal models or in experiments where the transcription factors were overexpressed. Furthermore the network predicted the inhibition of Irx3 by Nkx2.2 and this prediction was tested experimentally. Our results provide evidence for the existence of an as yet undescribed inhibitory connection which could potentially have significance beyond the ventral spinal cord.

In an attempt to answer this question, we explored skin wound healing in the long-lived transgenic ?MUPA mice, a unique model of genetically extended life span. These mice spontaneously eat less, preserve their body mass, are more resistant to spontaneous and induced tumorigenesis and live longer, thus greatly mimicking the effects of caloric restriction (CR). We found that ?MUPA mice showed a much slower age-related decline in the rate of WH than their wild-type counterparts (FVB/N). After full closure of the wound, gene expression in the skin of old ?MUPA mice returned close to basal levels. In contrast, old FVB/N mice still exhibited significant upregulation of genes associated with growth-promoting pathways, apoptosis and cell-cell/cell-extra cellular matrix interaction, indicating an ongoing tissue remodeling or an inability to properly shut down the repair process. It appears that the CR-like longevity phenotype is associated with more balanced and efficient WH mechanisms in old age, which could ensure a long-term survival advantage.","202047","Open Access","0.2166","-0.5178","13","Wound healing, Longevity phenotype","Wound healing, Longevity phenotype",0,NA,NA,"",""

Despite the accumulated knowledge, modulation of wound healing is still a major biomedical challenge, especially in advanced ages. In order to collect and systematically organize what we know about the key players in wound healing, we created the TiRe (Tissue Repair) database, an online collection of genes and proteins that were shown to directly affect skin wound healing. To date, TiRe contains 397 entries for four organisms: Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Sus domesticus, and Homo sapiens. Analysis of the TiRe dataset of skin wound healing-associated genes showed that skin wound healing genes are (i) over-conserved among vertebrates, but are under-conserved in invertebrates; (ii) enriched in extracellular and immuno-inflammatory genes; and display (iii) high interconnectivity and connectivity to other proteins. The latter may provide potential therapeutic targets. In addition, a slower or faster skin wound healing is indicative of an aging or longevity phenotype only when assessed in advanced ages, but not in the young. In the long run, we aim for TiRe to be a one-station resource that provides researchers and clinicians with the essential data needed for a better understanding of the mechanisms of wound healing, designing new experiments, and the development of new therapeutic strategies.

The results obtained showed that deletion of the selected longevity regulators in budding yeast had a significant impact on the polar mRNA transport. This included changes in the amount of mRNA-containing granules in cytoplasm, their aggregation and distribution between the mother and daughter cells. A significant negative correlation was found between strain-specific longevity, amount of granules and total fluorescent intensity both in mother and daughter cells. As indicated by the coefficient of determination, approximately 50–75% of variation in yeast lifespan could be attributed to the differences in polar mRNA transport.","202047","Open Access","0.4646","-0.4746","4","Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, Objective quantification, Abnormal remodeling","Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, Objective quantification, Abnormal remodeling",3,NA,NA,"",""
