Nanomaterials (NMs) display advantageous characteristics that enable innovative applications, as is the case of several metal and metal oxides such as titanium dioxide nanomaterials (TiO2), cerium dioxide (CeO2) and barium sulphate (BaSO4), that already have a broad range of applications in industry and consumer products. 
			However, the exponential development of nanotechnologies contrasts with the insufficient risk assessment for human health and the environment and reliable studies focused on nano-bio interactions are necessary1. 
			With the aim of contributing to a comprehensive investigation of the hazard of metal oxides NMs in human respiratory cells, we have used cytotoxicity and genotoxicity assays2, concomitantly with the analysis of the NMs’ properties in the cellular moiety. 
			The results show that only CeO2 has cytotoxic effects and TiO2 is genotoxic in the comet assay, but not clastogenic in the micronucleus assay. The remaining NMs are not genotoxic. The present results contribute to evaluate the hazard of the tested NMs, suggesting that some, but not all, metal NMs affect human respiratory cells. Considering the reports describing workers occupationally exposed to TiO23, this finding raises concerns for human health. Further studies are described that were designed to understand if this finding could be generalized to other TiO2 that are frequently used in consumer products. For tackling NMs’ uncertainties, an in-depth investigation of the nano-bio interactions must be foreseen, where correlation analysis with the primary and secondary physicochemical characteristics may enable grouping strategies valuable for risk assessment.

			Nanomaterials (NMs) and nanoparticles (NPs) have been studied intensively for almost two decades and still all the characteristics that might be beneficial or harmful  are not explored.  Although many studies have investigated the mechanisms of action of NPs in cells, results are not fully understood and in many cases are controversial.  Endpoints appropriate for detecting harmful chemicals such as cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammation, immunotoxicity, genotoxicity, and in some cases carcinogenicity, have been addressed. However, there might be also new mechanisms that might lead to NM-induced toxic effects.

A sua pequena dimensão confere-lhes propriedades físicas, químicas e biológicas que podem diferir bastante das propriedades dos materiais com a mesma composição química mas utilizados numa escala não nanométrica. São as propriedades mecânicas, óticas, elétricas e magnéticas inerentes aos materiais na escala “nano” que os tornam vantajosos para as mais diversas aplicações industriais e biomédicas. Contudo, a enorme expansão que tem vindo a acontecer ao nível da síntese, produção industrial e utilização de NMs contrasta com uma ainda insuficiente avaliação de risco para a saúde humana e para o ambiente. Efectivamente, A European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA,2009) considerou a exposição a NM como o risco emergente mais premente no contexto da saúde ocupacional, estimando que entre 300.000 a 400.000 postos de trabalho lidavam já directamente com as nanotecnologias. 
			Neste seminário será abordada a possibilidade de exposição ocupacional ao longo do ciclo de vida dos NM, bem como as suas potenciais implicações para a saúde dos trabalhadores. Nesta palestra são apresentados alguns estudos realizados no Instituto Nacional de Saúde Doutor Ricardo Jorge que produziram evidência científica que poderá contribuir para o esforço internacional da regulação da produção e aplicação de nanomateriais, salvaguardando a saúde humana face às suas aplicações inovadoras.

			need of ensuring the development of safe, integrated, and responsible nanotechnologies and nanotechnology products. Indeed, although the use of manufactured nanomaterials (NM) is widespread and has been considered greatly beneficial for several scientific and technological areas, uncertainties about their safety still remain, representing a challenge to scientists, risk assessors and regulators.
			Recent studies of the team have been aimed at assessing the potential deleterious effects, e.g., genotoxicity that is intimately associated with carcinogenicity, of several classes of NM, using complementary in vitro and in vivo approaches, nested within the conventional risk assessment paradigm. Overall, the results have suggested that specific physicochemical properties of NM are crucial to define their nano-bio interactions and their toxic potential. Furthermore, our findings reinforced previous reports suggesting that factors inherent to experimental conditions and methodologies may affect the effects observed. These and other nano-specific issues have been hindering the categorization of NM according to their toxicity and, consequently, their risk assessment and management. Nonetheless, considering the wide array of NM produced or under development, a case-by-case approach to the risks of each NM seems an unreasonably extensive task.
			Thus, the development of high-throughput omics-based tools adapted for the toxicity assessment of NM and, on the other hand, the elucidation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying NM toxicity is of utmost importance to progress faster in the field of nanotoxicology. Such information will allow the development of cost-efficient screening strategies and promote predictive nanotoxicology, driving the synthesis of safer NM. The ultimate goal is fostering a sustainable and safe innovation in the field of nanotechnologies.

Progress report","Maria João Silva, Henriqueta Louro","2016-09-01","","publication","","","","The toxicity of NMs in submerged conditions with the alveolar cell line A549 was finalized, concerning the four selected nanomaterials (NMs): TiO2 (NM-100 and NM-1001), CeO2 (NM-2102) and BaSO4 (NM-220). Cytotoxicity was analysed using the MTT assay and the colony forming efficiency assay (CFE or clonogenic assay). The alkaline comet plus the FPG-modified assays and the cytokynesis-blocked micronucleus assay were used to address the genotoxic effects. The tests were performed with A549 cells cultured in conventional submerged cultures. Following the recommendation of the guidance document, the quality of the NM batch dispersion, as well as that of the NM dilution in the complete cells exposure medium, were analyzed using dynamic light scattering (DLS) performed shortly after dispersion and after incubation during 24h, 72h and 7 days. Most of the batch dispersions were in similar size range of the NANoREG benchmark data. In general, the dilution of the batch in cell culture medium showed no major impact on NM sizes and, after 24h incubation, sedimentation of the NMs probably contributed to the observation of lower size dispersed NMs when analyzing the suspension by DLS.
			The CFE assay with A549 cells was used to assess the cytotoxicity of a set of NMs that were agreed upon with NILU to allow data comparison between the two laboratories.  Two alternative methods were used to perform the assay – exposure of cells at a high desnsity  to the NM (24h) or exposure of a small number of adherent cells to the NM during 7 days  – and the following NMs were tested: silver NMs (NM-300k and NM-302) as well as zinc oxide (NM-110), amorphous silicon dioxide (NM-2000 and NM-203), a multiwalled carbon nanotube (NM-401) and titanium dioxide (NM-103). 
			Also, within a collaborative work with NILU aimed at characterizing the genotoxicity of three metallic NMs using regulatory tests (the hprt mutation assay, the comet assay and the micronucleus assay) results from the micronucleus assay in V79 cells were obtained for NM-100, NM-302 and NM-2102. All results were analyzed using adequate statistical tools.
			All data have been uploaded into the NanoReg Database entry tool with the exception of CFE for which no model database has been produced. The later data will be sent to the task leaders in order to be uploaded at CIRCABC.

While the number of different NMs increases exponentially, new strategies for risk assessment are needed to cope with the safety issues, keeping pace with innovation. However, recent studies have suggested that even subtle differences in the physicochemical properties of NMs that are closely related may define different nano-bio interactions, thereby determining their toxic potential. Further research in this field is necessary to allow straightforward grouping strategies leading time-effective risk assessment to enable the safe use of the emerging NMs.
			In this presentation the case study of the in vitro toxicity testing of a set of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in two human cell lines from the respiratory tract will be described. Those MWCNT have been previously characterized in detail, and differ in thickness, length, aspect ratio and morphology. This comprehensive toxicological investigation undertaken in parallel with physicochemical characterization in the cellular moiety showed that the same NM did not display a consistent effect in different cell types, and that, within the same class of NM, different toxic effects could be observed. The correlation of the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects characterized in the two cell lines with their physicochemical properties will be presented and the relevance of considering the NMs properties in the biological context will be discussed.
			Overall, this case study suggests that nanotoxicity of closely related MWCNTs depends not only on their primary physicochemical properties, or combinations of these properties, but also on the cellular system, and its context. Challenges posed to toxicologists, risk assessors and regulators when addressing the safety assessment of NMs will be highlighted.

Data are needed for developing intelligent testing strategies for risk assessment of NMs, based on grouping and read?across approaches. The adoption of high throughput screening (HTS) and high content analysis (HCA) for NM toxicity testing allows the testing of numerous materials at different concentrations and on different types of cells, reduces the effect of inter?experimental variation, and makes substantial savings in time and cost. HTS/HCA approaches facilitate the classification of key biological indicators of NM?cell interactions. Validation of in vitro HTS tests is required, taking account of relevance to in vivo results. HTS/HCA approaches are needed to assess dose? and time?dependent toxicity, allowing prediction of in vivo adverse effects. Several HTS/HCA methods are being validated and applied for NM testing in the FP7 project NANoREG, including Label?free cellular screening of NM uptake, HCA, High throughput flow cytometry, Impedance?based monitoring, Multiplex analysis of secreted products, and genotoxicity methods?namely High throughput comet assay, High throughput in vitro micronucleus assay, and ?H2AX assay.

At the same time, inhalation of manufactured nano-objects has been related to an array of adverse biological effects. We characterized particle emissions, which occurred during maintenance of common metal nanoparticle generators and contrasted the properties of the emitted particles with those originally produced by the generators. A new approach using online aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS), for time-and size-resolved measurements of the particle chemical composition, was applied in combination with more conventional techniques for particle sampling and analysis, including electron microscopy. Emissions during maintenance work, in terms of mass and surface area concentration in the size range of 0.02-10 mu m, were dominated by large agglomerates (1-5 mu m). With AMS, we show that the particle composition depends on both generator type and maintenance task being performed and that the instrument can be used for highly time-resolved selective studies of metal nanoparticle emissions. The emitted agglomerates have a relatively high probability to be deposited in the lower respiratory tract, since the mean particle diameter coincided with a peak in the lung deposition curve. Each of these agglomerates consisted of a very high number (10(3)-10(5)/agglomerate) of nanometer-sized primary particles originating from the particle synthesis process. This made them possess large surface areas, one of the key properties in nanotoxicology. Similar agglomerates may be emitted in a wide range of processes when nanoparticles are manufactured or handled. The fate of such agglomerates, once deposited in the respiratory tract, is unknown and should therefore be considered in future particle toxicological studies.

We have evaluated three methods to investigate the adsorption of phenanthrene (a model polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; PAH) to CNTs with different physicochemical properties; dialysis tube (DT) protected negligible depletion solid phase microextraction (DT-nd-SPME), ultracentrifugation and filtration using various types of filters. Dispersed CNTs adhered to the unprotected PDMS-coated fibers used in nd-SPME. Protection of the fibers from CNT adherence was investigated with hydrophilic DT, but high PAH sorption to the DT was observed. The efficiency of ultracentrifugation and filtration to separate CNTs from the water phase depended on CNT physicochemical properties. While non-functionalized CNTs were efficiently separated from the water phase using ultracentrifugation, incomplete separation of carboxyl functionalized CNTs was observed. Filtration efficiency varied with different filter types (composition and pore size), and non-functionalized CNTs were more easily separated from the water phase than functionalized CNTs. Sorption of phenanthrene was high (<70%) for three of the filters tested, making them unsuitable for the assessment of phenanthrene adsorption to CNTs. Filtration using a hydrophilic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter membrane (0.1 µm) was found to be a simple and precise technique for the determination of phenanthrene adsorption to a range of CNTs, efficiently separating all types of CNTs and exhibiting a good and highly reproducible recovery of phenanthrene (82%) over the concentration range tested (70-735 µg/L).

Many different NMs, alone or in combination,in the form of fibers, tubes, or particles have been already proposed for innovative diagnostic, drug delivery platforms and nanostructured matrices for tissue engineering applications. Presently, the diversity of NMs that are being used, or explored as candidates, for tissue engineering can be classified into different groups (polymers, ceramics,carbon nanotubes [CNTs], metals and composites), depending on their chemical composition. This chapter describes the importance of genotoxicity evaluation to warrant the safety of these innovative NMs, with particular emphasis on the most prominent testing strategies that must consider and incorporate the specific physicochemical characteristics of the nanosized materials into toxicological research.

			The fast development of nanotechnology has led to the manufacturing of a wide array of nanomaterials (NMs). Despite the number of studies addressing NMs toxicity, uncertainties about their safety remain, representing a challenge to regulatory authorities. This work intended to assess the toxicity of metallic NMs in alveolar epithelial cells and to relate the effects with their physicochemical properties.

			Benchmark NMs (JRC) - CeO2 (NM-212), TiO2 (NM-100) and BaSO4 (NM-220) - were dispersed and their properties in the culture medium were evaluated by DLS. A549 cells were exposed to each NM for cytotoxicity (MTT and plating efficiency assays) and genotoxicity (comet and cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus, CBMN, assays) assessment.

			A homogeneous dispersion that remained stable in culture medium was achieved for all NMs.  The CeO2NM was the only one that decreased cells’ proliferative capacity after 8 days exposure.  As to the genotoxicity, the TiO2NM significantly increased the level of DNA damage following 3h and 24h exposure, whereas the CeO2NM caused only a slight increase in DNA damage at 3h exposure. None of the NMs tested positive by the CBMN assay. BaSO4NM was neither cytotoxic nor genotoxic.

			In conclusion, this study contributed to the hazard assessment of different benchmark metallic NMs, disclosing diverse biological effects that will be interpreted considering the inherent physicochemical properties. The identification of key features and pathways that drive NMs’ toxicity is paramount to allow prediction of their adverse effects, avoiding the huge task of testing every new NM.

			In the current paper, a new strategy for risk assessment of nanomaterials is described, which builds upon previous project outcomes and is developed within the FP7 NANoREG project. NANoREG has the aim to develop, for the long term, new testing strategies adapted to a high number of nanomaterials where many factors can affect their environmental and health impact. In the proposed risk assessment strategy, approaches for (Quantitative) Structure Activity Relationships ((Q)SARs), grouping and read-across are integrated and expanded to guide the user how to prioritise those nanomaterial applications that may lead to high risks for human health. Furthermore, those aspects of exposure, kinetics and hazard assessment that are most likely to be influenced by the nanospecific properties of the material under assessment are identified. These aspects are summarised in six elements, which play a key role in the strategy: exposure potential, dissolution, nanomaterial transformation, accumulation, genotoxicity and immunotoxicity.

			With the current approach it is possible to identify those situations where the use of nanospecific grouping, read-across and (Q)SAR tools is likely to become feasible in the future, and to point towards the generation of the type of data that is needed for scientific justification, which may lead to regulatory acceptance of nanospecific applications of these tools.

We address this by establishing ZnO NP solubility in dispersion media (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, DMEM) held under conditions identical to those employed for cell culture (37 °C, 5% CO2, and pH 7.68) and by systematic comparison of cell–NP interaction for three different ZnO NP preparations. For NPs at concentrations up to 5.5 μg ZnO/mL, dissolution is complete (with the majority of the soluble zinc complexed to dissolved ligands in the medium), taking ca. 1 h for uncoated and ca. 6 h for polymer coated ones. Above 5.5 μg/mL, the results are consistent with the formation of zinc carbonate, keeping the solubilized zinc fixed to 67 μM of which only 0.45 μM is as free Zn2+, i.e., not complexed to dissolved ligands. At these relatively high concentrations, NPs with an aliphatic polyether-coating show slower dissolution (i.e., slower free Zn2+ release) and reprecipitation kinetics compared to those of uncoated NPs, requiring more than 48 h to reach thermodynamic equilibrium. Cytotoxicity (MTT) and DNA damage (Comet) assay dose–response curves for three epithelial cell lines suggest that dissolution and reprecipitation dominate for uncoated ZnO NPs. Transmission electron microscopy combined with the monitoring of intracellular Zn2+ concentrations and ZnO–NP interactions with model lipid membranes indicate that an aliphatic polyether coat on ZnO NPs increases cellular uptake, enhancing toxicity by enabling intracellular dissolution and release of Zn2+. Similarly, we demonstrate that needle-like NP morphologies enhance toxicity by apparently frustrating cellular uptake. To limit toxicity, ZnO NPs with nonacicular morphologies and coatings that only weakly interact with cellular membranes are recommended.

Evidence for a direct interaction between SWCNTs and CYP3A4 was also provided. The inhibition of enzyme activity was alleviated when SWCNTs were pre-coated with bovine serum albumin. Furthermore, covalent functionalization of SWCNTs with polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains mitigated the inhibition of CYP3A4 enzymatic activity. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that inhibition of the catalytic activity of CYP3A4 is mainly due to blocking of the exit channel for substrates/products through a complex binding mechanism. This work suggests that SWCNTs could interfere with metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics and provides a molecular mechanism for this toxicity.

Commercial MWCNT vary greatly in physicochemical properties and consequently in biological effects. To identify determinants of MWCNT-induced toxicity, we analyzed the effects of pulmonary exposure to 10 commercial MWCNT (supplied in three groups of different dimensions, with one pristine and two/three surface modified in each group). We characterized morphology, chemical composition, surface area and functionalization levels. MWCNT were deposited in lungs of female C57BL/6J mice by intratracheal instillation of 0, 6, 18 or 54??g/mouse. Pulmonary inflammation (neutrophil influx in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)) and genotoxicity were determined on day 1, 28 or 92. Histopathology of the lungs was performed on day 28 and 92. All MWCNT induced similar histological changes. Lymphocytic aggregates were detected for all MWCNT on day 28 and 92. Using adjusted, multiple regression analyses, inflammation and genotoxicity were related to dose, time and physicochemical properties. The specific surface area (BET) was identified as a positive predictor of pulmonary inflammation on all post-exposure days. In addition, length significantly predicted pulmonary inflammation, whereas surface oxidation (?OH and ?COOH) was predictor of lowered inflammation on day 28. BET surface area, and therefore diameter, significantly predicted genotoxicity in BAL fluid cells and lung tissue such that lower BET surface area or correspondingly larger diameter was associated with increased genotoxicity. This study provides information on possible toxicity-driving physicochemical properties of MWCNT. The results may contribute to safe-by-design manufacturing of MWCNT, thereby minimizing adverse effects.","310584","Open Access","-0.2989","0.6273","9","Carbon nanotube physicochemical, Epoxy composite dusts, Differences in liver","Carbon nanotube physicochemical, Epoxy composite dusts, Differences in liver","1","20","16","",""

In vivo quantification of Chl-a from Raphidocelis subcapitata indicated a significant reduction in Chl-a fluorescence in the presence of MWCNTs due to shading, but a significant autofluorescence from GO that caused an overestimation of Chl-a concentration. In vitro Chl-a quantification methods employing a modified acetone and an ethanol extraction protocol reduced the influence of shading and autofluorescence, but both resulted in a significant loss of fluorescence signal in the presence of 100 mg L−1 MWCNTS (99-100%) and GO (21-52%). Chl-a reduction was dose dependent for both tested CNM materials, but effects were more pronounced for MWCNT, which caused a significant fluorescence reduction (16±0.3%) already at 1 mg L−1. Further study of the CNM-algae-Chl-a interaction processes revealed that CNM can not only interact with live algae, but also efficiently adsorb extracted Chl-a. Our results showed that within 10 min, 95-100% of Chl-a extracted from two algae concentrations were adsorbed to MWCNT, while 35-60% of Chl-a was adsorbed to the GO. This study shows that Chl-a quantification by fluorescence determination is not a suitable method for ecotoxicity testing of CNM. However, a quick screening test for individual MNMs is recommended to determine if Chl-a adsorption is a significant process prior to selection of a quantification method.

However, related exposure data remain limited. In this context, information about the dustiness of CNT is therefore of great interest, for example for control banding or exposure modelling. Here, we investigate the dustiness of fourteen CNT powders using the Vortex Shaker (VS) method. The central component of the VS method is a stainless steel cylindrical tube, continuously shaken in a circular orbital motion, in which a small volume (0.5 cm 3) of the powder to be tested is placed. All samples were obtained through the NANoREG Nanomaterials Information and Web-Order system. The test procedure that we have developed is based on four principal components: (i) a respirable cyclone for gravimetric sampling, (ii) a CPC as a reference instrument for number concentration measurement, (iii) an MPS for collection of particles for EM observations/analysis, and (iv) an ELPI for size-resolved aerosol measurement. In this paper, the data were evaluated using two parameters: (i) the mass-based dustiness index in the respirable fraction; and (ii) the number-based dustiness index in the respirable fraction. The results indicate that the method leads to relatively accurate mass-and number-based dustiness indices. The indices obtained span wide ranges, of 2 and 3 orders of magnitude variation for mass and number respectively, suggesting a corresponding significant difference in terms of potential exposure. EM observations reveal that airborne CNTs are mostly released as bundles of different shapes ranging from a few tens of nanometers up to tens of micrometers in size.; La manipulation de nanotubes de carbone (NTC) sous la forme d'une poudre est un scénario d'exposition plausible et qui peut être rencontré sur l'ensemble du cycle de vie des NTC.

Measurements with highly time- and size-resolved DRI techniques were carried out both in the emission and background (far-field) zones. Novel classifications and counting criteria were set up for the SEM method. Three classes of CNT-containing particles were defined: type 1: particles with aspect ratio length:width &gt;3:1 (fibrous particles); type 2: particles without fibre characteristics but with high CNT content; and type 3: particles with visible embedded CNTs.<br />
			<br />
			Results: Offline sampling using SEM showed emissions of CNT-containing particles in 5 out of 11 work tasks. The particles were classified into the three classes, of which type 1, fibrous CNT particles contributed 37%. The concentration of all CNT-containing particles and the occurrence of the particle classes varied strongly between work tasks. Based on the emission measurements, it was assessed that more than 85% of the exposure originated from open handling of CNT powder during the Sieving, mechanical work-up, and packaging work task. The DRI measurements provided complementary information, which combined with SEM provided information on: (i) the background adjusted emission concentration from each work task in different particle size ranges, (ii) identification of the key procedures in each work task that lead to emission peaks, (iii) identification of emission events that affect the background, thereby leading to far-field exposure risks for workers other than the operator of the work task, and (iv) the fraction of particles emitted from each source that contains CNTs.<br />
			<br />
			Conclusions: There is an urgent need for a standardized/harmonized method for electron microscopy (EM) analysis of CNTs. The SEM method developed in this study can form the basis for such a harmonized protocol for the counting of CNTs. The size-resolved DRI techniques are commonly not specific enough to selective analysis of CNT-containing particles and thus cannot yet replace offline time-integrated filter sampling followed by SEM. A combination of EM and DRI techniques offers the most complete characterization of workplace emissions of CNTs today.","310584","Open Access","-0.5999","0.1498","1","Electron microscopy, Size shape","Electron microscopy, Size shape",NA,NA,"1","",""

The main aim of this study was to investigate the genotoxicity of three reference TiO2 nanomaterials (NM) within the frame of the FP7-NANoREG project, with a particular focus on testing the applicability of mini-gel comet assay and micronucleus (MN) scoring by flow cytometry. BEAS-2B cells cultured under serum-free conditions were exposed to NM100 (anatase, 50?150nm), NM101 (anatase, 5?8nm) and NM103 (rutile, 20?28nm) for 3, 24 or 48h mainly at concentrations 1?30 ?g/ml. In the mini-gel comet assay (eight gels per slide), we included analysis of (i) DNA strand breaks, (ii) oxidised bases (Fpg-sensitive sites) and (iii) light-induced DNA damage due to photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, MN assays were used and we compared the results of more high-throughput MN scoring with flow cytometry to that of cytokinesis-block MN cytome assay scored manually using a microscope. Various methods were used to assess cytotoxic effects and the results showed in general no or low effects at the doses tested. A weak genotoxic effect of the tested TiO2 materials was observed with an induction of oxidised bases for all three materials of which NM100 was the most potent. When the comet slides were briefly exposed to lab light, a clear induction of DNA strand breaks was observed for the anatase materials, but not for the rutile. This highlights the risk of false positives when testing photocatalytically active materials if light is not properly avoided. A slight increase in MN formation for NM103 was observed in the different MN assays at the lower doses tested (1 and 5 ?g/ml). We conclude that mini-gel comet assay and MN scoring using flow cytometry successfully can be used to efficiently study cytotoxic and genotoxic properties of nanoparticles.","310584","Open Access","0.0694","0.1646","7","Genotoxicidade ambiental, Metallic nanomaterials, Nanoreg project","Genotoxicidade ambiental, Metallic nanomaterials, Nanoreg project",NA,"26","13","",""

They have been extensively used in a broad range of applications and cover most of the industrial sectors as well as the medicine and the environmental areas. The most common scenarios for human exposure to NMs are occupational, environmental and as consumers and inhalation is the most frequent route of exposure, especially in occupational settings. Cerium dioxide NMs (nano-CeO2) are widely used in a number of applications such as in cosmetics, outdoor paints, wood care products as well as fuel catalysts. For such reason, nano-CeO2 is one of the selected NMs for priority testing within the sponsorship program of the Working Party of Manufactured Nanomaterials of the OECD. In this context, the aim of this study is to assess the safety of nano-CeO2 (NM-212, Joint Research Center Repository) through the characterization of its cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in a human alveolar epithelial cell line.
			A dispersion of the NM in water plus 0.05% BSA was prepared and sonicated during 16 minutes, according to a standardized protocol. DLS analysis was used to characterize the quality of the NM dispersion in the culture medium. To evaluate the cytotoxicity of nano-CeO2 in the A549 cell line, the colorimetric MTT assay was performed; the capacity of cells to proliferate when exposed to CeO2 was also assessed with the Clonogenic assay. The genotoxicity of this NM was evaluated by the Comet Assay (3 and 24h of exposure) to quantify DNA breaks and the FPG-modified comet assay to assess oxidative DNA damage. The Cytokinesis-Block Micronucleus (CBMN) assay was used to further detect chromosome breaks or loss. 
			The nano-CeO2 particles are spherical, displaying a diameter of 33 nm and 28 m2/g of surface area. The results of the MTT assay did not show any decreased in cells viability following treatment with a dose-range of nano-CeO2 during 24h. Nevertheless, the highest concentrations of this NM were able to significantly reduce the colony forming ability of A549 cells, suggesting that a prolonged exposure may be cytotoxic to these cells. Data from both genotoxicity assays revealed that nano-CeO2 was neither able to induce DNA breaks nor oxidative DNA damage. Likewise, no significant micronucleus induction was observed. Taken together, the present results indicate that this nano-CeO2 is not genotoxic in this alveolar cell line under the tested conditions, although further studies should be performed, e.g., gene mutation in somatic cells and in vivo chromosome damage (rodent micronucleus assay) to ensure its safety to human health.","310584","Open Access","0.3468","0.3193","7","Genotoxicidade ambiental, Metallic nanomaterials, Nanoreg project","Genotoxicidade ambiental, Metallic nanomaterials, Nanoreg project",NA,NA,"3","",""

A wide range of toxicity studies have been performed on various AgNPs, but these studies report a high variation in toxicity and often lack proper particle characterization. The aim of this study was to investigate size- and coating-dependent toxicity of thoroughly characterized AgNPs following exposure of human lung cells and to explore the mechanisms of toxicity. Methods BEAS-2B cells were exposed to citrate coated AgNPs of different primary particle sizes (10, 40 and 75 nm) as well as to 10 nm PVP coated and 50 nm uncoated AgNPs. The particle agglomeration in cell medium was investigated by photon cross correlation spectroscopy (PCCS); cell viability by LDH and Alamar Blue assay; ROS induction by DCFH-DA assay; genotoxicity by alkaline comet assay and γH2AX foci formation; uptake and intracellular localization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM); and cellular dose as well as Ag release by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). Results The results showed cytotoxicity only of the 10 nm particles independent of surface coating. In contrast, all AgNPs tested caused an increase in overall DNA damage after 24 h assessed by the comet assay, suggesting independent mechanisms for cytotoxicity and DNA damage. However, there was no γH2AX foci formation and no increased production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). The reasons for the higher toxicity of the 10 nm particles were explored by investigating particle agglomeration in cell medium, cellular uptake, intracellular localization and Ag release. Despite different agglomeration patterns, there was no evident difference in the uptake or intracellular localization of the citrate and PVP coated AgNPs. However, the 10 nm particles released significantly more Ag compared with all other AgNPs (approx. 24 wt% vs. 4–7 wt%) following 24 h in cell medium. The released fraction in cell medium did not induce any cytotoxicity, thus implying that intracellular Ag release was responsible for the toxicity. Conclusions This study shows that small AgNPs (10 nm) are cytotoxic for human lung cells and that the toxicity observed is associated with the rate of intracellular Ag release, a ‘Trojan horse’ effect.","310584","Open Access","-0.1031","0.3944","11","Genotoxicity, Oxide nanoparticles","Genotoxicity, Oxide nanoparticles","2","243","284","",""

The ToxTracker assay is a recently developed mechanism-based reporter assay based on mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells that uses GFP-tagged biomarkers for detection of DNA damage, oxidative stress and general cellular stress upon exposure. Here, we evaluated the ability of the ToxTracker assay to identify the hazardous properties and underlying mechanisms of a panel of metal oxide- and silver nanoparticles (NPs) as well as additional non-metallic materials (diesel, carbon nanotubes and quartz). Methods The metal oxide- and silver nanoparticles were characterized in terms of agglomeration and ion release in cell medium (using photon cross correlation spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma with optical emission spectroscopy, respectively) as well as acellular ROS production (DCFH-DA assay). Cellular uptake was investigated by means of transmission electron microscopy. GFP reporter induction and cytotoxicity of the NPs was simultaneously determined using flow cytometry, and genotoxicity was further tested using conventional assays (comet assay, γ-H2AX and RAD51 foci formation). Results We show that the reporter cells were able to take up nanoparticles and, furthermore, that exposure to CuO, NiO and ZnO nanoparticles as well as to quartz resulted in activation of the oxidative stress reporter, although only at high cytotoxicity for ZnO. NiO NPs activated additionally a p53-associated cellular stress response, indicating additional reactive properties. Conventional assays for genotoxicity assessment confirmed the response observed in the ToxTracker assay. We show for CuO NPs that the induction of oxidative stress is likely the consequence of released Cu ions whereas the effect by NiO was related to the particles per se. The DNA replication stress-induced reporter, which is most strongly associated with carcinogenicity, was not activated by any of the tested nanoparticles. Conclusions We conclude that the ToxTracker reporter system can be used as a rapid mechanism-based tool for the identification of hazardous properties of metal oxide NPs. Furthermore, genotoxicity of metal oxide NPs seems to occur mainly via oxidative stress rather than direct DNA binding with subsequent replication stress.","2300152170","Open Access","0.0957","0.5381","11","Genotoxicity, Oxide nanoparticles","Genotoxicity, Oxide nanoparticles",NA,NA,"34","",""

In our study we focused on assessing the size-dependence of the toxicity of nanosilver (Ag ENMs), utilising materials of three sizes (50, 80 and 200?nm) synthesized by the same method, with the same chemical composition, charge and coating. Methods Uptake and localisation (by Transmission Electron Microscopy), cell proliferation (Relative growth activity) and cytotoxic effects (Plating efficiency), inflammatory response (induction of IL-8 and MCP-1 by Enzyme linked immune sorbent assay), DNA damage (strand breaks and oxidised DNA lesions by the Comet assay) were all assessed in human lung carcinoma epithelial cells (A549), and the mutagenic potential of ENMs (Mammalian hprt gene mutation test) was assessed in V79-4 cells as per the OECD protocol. Detailed physico-chemical characterization of the ENMs was performed in water and in biological media as a prerequisite to assessment of their impacts on cells. To study the relationship between the surface area of the ENMs and the number of ENMs with the biological response observed, Ag ENMs concentrations were recalculated from ?g/cm2 to ENMs cm2/cm2 and ENMs/cm2. Results Studied Ag ENMs are cytotoxic and cytostatic, and induced strand breaks, DNA oxidation, inflammation and gene mutations. Results expressed in mass unit [?g/cm2] suggested that the toxicity of Ag ENMs is size dependent with 50?nm being most toxic. However, re-calculation of Ag ENMs concentrations from mass unit to surface area and number of ENMs per cm2 highlighted that 200?nm Ag ENMs, are the most toxic. Results from hprt gene mutation assay showed that Ag ENMs 200?nm are the most mutagenic irrespective of the concentration unit expressed. Conclusion We found that the toxicity of Ag ENMs is not always size dependent. Strong cytotoxic and genotoxic effects were observed in cells exposed to Ag ENMs 50?nm, but Ag ENMs 200?nm had the most mutagenic potential. Additionally, we showed that expression of concentrations of ENMs in mass units is not representative. Number of ENMs or surface area of ENMs (per cm2) seem more precise units with which to compare the toxicity of different ENMs. Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12989-014-0065-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","214547","Open Access","-0.1392","0.5749","14","Charge and surface, Dna lesions, Effects of charge","Charge and surface, Dna lesions, Effects of charge","2","40","25","",""

We were interested in whether Ag ENMs synthesized by the same method, with the same size distribution, shape and specific surface area, but with different charges and surface compositions could give different biological responses. Methods A range of methods and toxicity endpoints were applied to study the impacts of interaction of the Ag ENMs with TK6 cells. As tests of viability, relative growth activity and trypan blue exclusion were applied. Genotoxicity was evaluated by the alkaline comet assay for detection of strand breaks and oxidized purines. The mutagenic potential of Ag ENMs was investigated with the in vitro HPRT gene mutation test on V79-4 cells according to the OECD protocol. Ag ENM agglomeration, dissolution as well as uptake and distribution within the cells were investigated as crucial aspects of Ag ENM toxicity. Ag ENM stabilizers were included in addition to positive and negative controls. Results Different cytotoxic effects were observed including membrane damage, cell cycle arrest and cell death. Ag ENMs also induced various kinds of DNA damage including strand breaks and DNA oxidation, and caused gene mutation. We found that positive Ag ENMs had greater impact on cyto- and genotoxicity than did Ag ENMs with neutral or negative charge, assumed to be related to their greater uptake into cells and?to their presence in the nucleus and mitochondria, implying that Ag ENMs might induce toxicity by both direct and indirect mechanisms. Conclusion We showed that Ag ENMs could be cytotoxic, genotoxic and mutagenic. Our experiments with the HPRT gene mutation assay demonstrated that surface chemical composition plays a significant role in Ag ENM toxicity.","214547","Open Access","-0.0712","0.5705","14","Charge and surface, Dna lesions, Effects of charge","Charge and surface, Dna lesions, Effects of charge","2","30","20","",""

Methods Mice received a single intratracheal instillation of 18, 54 and 162??g of CNT or 54, 162 and 486??g of the sanding dust from epoxy composite with and without CNT. DNA damage in lung and liver, lung inflammation and liver histology were evaluated 1, 3 and 28?days after intratracheal instillation. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of interleukin 6 and heme oxygenase 1 was measured in the lungs and serum amyloid A1 in the liver. Printex 90 carbon black was included as a reference particle. Results Pulmonary exposure to CNT and all dusts obtained by sanding epoxy composite boards resulted in recruitment of inflammatory cells into lung lumen: On day 1 after instillation these cells were primarily neutrophils but on day 3, eosinophils contributed significantly to the cell population. There were still increased numbers of neutrophils 28?days after intratracheal instillation of the highest dose of the epoxy dusts. Both CNT and epoxy dusts induced DNA damage in lung tissue up to 3?days after intratracheal instillation but not in liver tissue.

Although biological studies have shown CeO2 nanoparticles can cause adverse health effects, the extent of the biodistribution of CeO2 nanoparticles through inhalation has not been well characterized. Furthermore, freshly emitted CeO2 nanoparticles can undergo an aging process by interaction with other ambient airborne pollutants that may influence the biodistribution after inhalation. Therefore, understanding the pharmacokinetic of newly-generated and atmospherically-aged CeO2 nanoparticles is needed to assess the risks to human health. Methods A novel experimental system was designed to integrate the generation, aging, and inhalation exposure of Sprague Dawley rats to combustion-generated CeO2 nanoparticles (25 and 90?nm bimodal distribution). Aging was done in a chamber representing typical ambient urban air conditions with UV lights. Following a single 4-hour nose-only exposure to freshly emitted or aged CeO2 for 15?min, 24?h, and 7?days, ICP-MS detection of Ce in the blood, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen, kidneys, heart, brain, olfactory bulb, urine, and feces were analyzed with a mass balance approach to gain an overarching understanding of the distribution. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model that includes mucociliary clearance, phagocytosis, and entry into the systemic circulation by alveolar wall penetration was developed to predict the biodistribution kinetic of the inhaled CeO2 nanoparticles. Results Cerium was predominantly recovered in the lungs and feces, with extrapulmonary organs contributing less than 4?% to the recovery rate at 24?h post exposure. No significant differences in biodistribution patterns were found between fresh and aged CeO2 nanoparticles. The PBPK model predicted the biodistribution well and identified phagocytizing cells in the pulmonary region accountable for most of the nanoparticles not eliminated by feces. Conclusions The biodistribution of fresh and aged CeO2 nanoparticles followed the same patterns, with the highest amounts recovered in the feces and lungs. The slow decrease of nanoparticle concentrations in the lungs can be explained by clearance to the gastrointestinal tract and then to the feces. The PBPK model successfully predicted the kinetic of CeO2 nanoparticles in various organs measured in this study and suggested most of the nanoparticles were captured by phagocytizing cells.

In order to evaluate the reaction of human colon cells to USPIO NPs, the effects of non-stabilized USPIO NPs (NS-USPIO NPs), oleic-acid-stabilized USPIO NPs (OA-USPIO NPs), and free oleic acid (OA) were compared in human HT29&amp;nbsp;and CaCo2&amp;nbsp;colon epithelial cancer cells. First the biophysical characteristics of NS-USPIO NPs and OA-USPIO NPs in water, in cell culture medium supplemented with fetal calf serum, and in cell culture medium preconditioned by HT29&amp;nbsp;and CaCo2&amp;nbsp;cells were determined. Then, stress responses of the cells were evaluated following exposure to NS-USPIO NPs, OA-USPIO NPs, and free OA. No modification of the cytoskeletal actin network was observed. Cell response to stress, including markers of apoptosis and DNA repair, oxidative stress and degradative/autophagic stress, induction of heat shock protein, or lipid metabolism was determined in cells exposed to the two NPs. Induction of an autophagic response was observed in the two cell lines for both NPs but not free OA, while the other stress responses were cell- and NP-specific. The formation of lipid vacuoles/droplets was demonstrated in HT29&amp;nbsp;and CaCo2&amp;nbsp;cells exposed to OA-USPIO NPs but not to NS-USPIO NPs, and to a much lower level in cells exposed to equimolar concentrations of free OA. Therefore, the induction of lipid vacuoles in colon cells exposed to OA utilized as a stabilizer for USPIO NPs is higly amplified compared to free OA, and is not observed in the absence of this lipid in NS-USPIO NPs.Keywords: oleic acid, ultrasmall iron oxide nanoparticles, human colon cells, lipid vacuoles, stress reaction, heat shock proteins","310584","Open Access","0.0615","0.7275","11","Genotoxicity, Oxide nanoparticles","Genotoxicity, Oxide nanoparticles",NA,NA,"0","",""

Experience with industrial chemicals and pharmaceutical drugs reveals that biokinetics can be described and predicted accurately by physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling. The nano PBPK models developed to date all concern a single type of NP. Our aim here was to extend a recent model for pegylated polyacrylamide NP in order to develop a more general PBPK model for nondegradable NPs injected intravenously into rats. The same model and physiological parameters were applied to pegylated polyacrylamide, uncoated polyacrylamide, gold, and titanium dioxide NPs, whereas NP-specific parameters were chosen on the basis of the best fit to the experimental time-courses of NP accumulation in various tissues. Our model describes the biokinetic behavior of all four types of NPs adequately, despite extensive differences in this behavior as well as in their physicochemical properties. In&amp;nbsp;addition, this simulation demonstrated that the dose exerts a profound impact on the biokinetics, since saturation of the phagocytic cells at higher doses becomes a major limiting step. The fitted model parameters that were most dependent on NP type included the blood:tissue coefficients of permeability and the rate constant for phagocytic uptake. Since only four types of NPs with several differences in characteristics (dose, size, charge, shape, and surface properties) were used, the relationship between these characteristics and the NP-dependent model parameters could not be elucidated and more experimental data are required in this context. In this connection, intravenous biodistribution studies with associated PBPK analyses would provide the most insight.

If nanomaterial is completely soluble, then from a risk assessment point of view, its disposal can be treated much in the same way as “ordinary” chemicals, which will simplify testing and characterisation regimes. This review assesses potential techniques for the measurement of nanomaterial solubility and evaluates the performance against a set of analytical criteria (based on satisfying the requirements as governed by the cosmetic regulation as well as the need to quantify the concentration of free (hydrated) ions). Our findings show that no universal method exists. A complementary approach is thus recommended, to comprise an atomic spectrometry-based method in conjunction with an electrochemical (or colorimetric) method. This article shows that although some techniques are more commonly used than others, a huge research gap remains, related with the need to ensure data reliability.

			Given the presence of engineered nanomaterials in consumers’ products and their application in nanomedicine, nanosafety assessment is becoming increasingly important. In particular, immunosafety aspects are being actively investigated. In nanomaterial immunosafety testing strategies, it is important to consider that nanomaterials and nanoparticles are very easy to become contaminated with endotoxin, which is a widespread contaminant coming from the Gram-negative bacterial cell membrane. Because of the potent inflammatory activity of endotoxin, contaminated nanomaterials can show inflammatory/toxic effects due to endotoxin, which may mask or misidentify the real biological effects (or lack thereof) of nanomaterials. Therefore, before running immunosafety assays, either in vitro or in vivo, the presence of endotoxin in nanomaterials must be evaluated. This calls for using appropriate assays with proper controls, because many nanomaterials interfere at various levels with the commercially available endotoxin detection methods. This also underlines the need to develop robust and bespoke strategies for endotoxin evaluation in nanomaterials.

The aim of this study was to develop a new method to unmask asbestos nanofibers from Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissue. For the first time, in this study we applied Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis through transmission electron microscopy to demonstrate the presence of asbestos nanofibers in histological specimens of patients with possible occupational exposure to asbestos. The diagnostic protocol was applied to 10 randomly selected lung cancer patients with no history of previous asbestos exposure. We detected asbestos nanofibers in close contact with lung cancer cells in two lung cancer patients with previous possible occupational exposure to asbestos. We were also able to identify the specific asbestos iso-type, which in one of the cases was the same rare variety used in the workplace of the affected patient. By contrast, asbestos nanofibers were not detected in lung cancer patients with no history of occupational asbestos exposure. The proposed technique can represent a potential useful tool for linking the disease to previous workplace exposure in uncertain cases. Furthermore, Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissues stored in the pathology departments might be re-evaluated for possible etiological attribution to asbestos in the case of plausible exposure. Since diseases acquired through occupational exposure to asbestos are generally covered by workers’ insurance in most countries, the application of the protocol used in this study may have also relevant social and economic implications. </p>","310584","Open Access","-0.5779","-0.3619","10","Analysis of histological, Nano asbestos fibers, Buccal mucosa models","Analysis of histological, Nano asbestos fibers, Buccal mucosa models",NA,NA,"5","",""

			Statement of the Problem: The manufactured nanomaterials (NMs) have specific physicochemical properties that confer unique characteristics beneficial for biomedical and industrial applications, but that can also determine nano-bio interactions leading to toxic potential. However, the investigation of the genotoxic properties of NMs has been mostly inconclusive, since divergent results have been reported in the literature. To contribute for the safety assessment of NMs, it is important to try to ascertain the NM characteristic that determines the adverse effects, allowing the synthesis of innovative NMs devoid of toxicity.
			Objective and Methodology: The present work explores the correlation between physicochemical properties of benchmark NMs (multi-walled carbon nanotubes, MWCNTs) and their cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in human respiratory cells (A549 and Beas-2B), through the MTT, clonogenic, micronucleus and comet assays.
			Conclusion & Significance: After 8-days exposure, the clonogenic assay showed cytotoxic effects in A549 cells for all the tested MWCNTs. Correlation analysis suggested an association between the MWCNT size in cell culture medium and cytotoxicity. No induction of DNA damage was observed after any MWCNT exposure in any cell line by the comet assay, while the micronucleus assay revealed that both NM-401 and NM-402 were genotoxic in A549 cells. NM-401 and NM-402 are the two longest MWCNTs analyzed in this work, suggesting that length may be determinant for genotoxicity. No induction of micronuclei was observed in the Beas-2B cell line. The different effects in both cell lines is explained in view of the size-distribution of MWCNTs in the cell culture medium, rather than cell’s specificities. Therefore, tackling NMs safety issues is a complex and challenging issue. It is mandatory that toxicologists adequately characterize both the primary and secondary physicochemical properties of the test nanomaterials and use several endpoints to allow a correct interpretation of data.

In particular, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) have been developed for industrial purposes, but the same properties that render these materials so attractive may also cause higher toxicity. However, contradictory results concerning their genotoxicity and carcinogenicity have been reported, suggesting that minor changes in physicochemical properties may determine their toxicity. The objective of this work was to characterize the cyto- and genotoxic effects of MWCNTs that differ in thickness, length and aspect ratio (NM-401, NM-402 and NM-403, JRC repository) in human-derived bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B), in order to ascertain which characteristic(s) may be determinant for their genotoxicity.
			After NM dispersion using a standardized protocol, cell cultures were exposed to several NM concentrations (0-256 μg/ml). Cell viability was evaluated by the Trypan blue dye exclusion assay. For genotoxicty testing, a combination of the alkaline comet assay (3- or 24h- exposure) and the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus assay (48h-exposure) was used. The results showed that NM-401 and NM-403 were cytotoxic following 24h exposure, whereas the highest doses of NM-402 were cytotoxic at 3h. The genotoxicity results in relation to the different MWCNT tested were not consistent, indicating that diameter and length are rather important properties that influence the genotoxic potential of these NM.
			In summary, our work confirmed that the standard genotoxicity tests can be applied for evaluating the genotoxicity of different types of MWCNT. However, we also concluded that specific physicochemical properties impact on the genotoxic potential of these high aspect ratio NM, an issue that has to be further understood, possibly by targeted testing. Regarding safety assessment and related regulatory aspects, the differential genotoxicity observed for closely related NM highlights the importance of investigating the toxic potential of each NM individually, instead of assuming a common mechanism and equal genotoxic effects for a set of similar NM.

			Statement of the Problem: The emergence of newly developed nanomaterials (NMs), with physicochemical features useful for innovative applications in consumer products and medicine, generated the need of fast- and cost-effective toxicology screening strategies for safety assessment. Overall toxicity can be evaluated using survival or cell death as an endpoint. However, in view of the NMs’ specificities, many methods are vulnerable to interference of the NMs with the detection process. We analyzed the cytotoxic effects of a panel of 10 benchmark NMs in respiratory cells (A549) using plating efficiency (PE) assay, and compared with a spectrophotometric method. Methodology: The NMs were used for PE assay in cells exposed for 7 days to silicon dioxide (NM-200 and NM-203), titanium dioxide(NM-100, NM-101, NM-103), silver (NM-300 k, NM-302), cerium oxide (NM-212), barium sulphate (NM-220), zinc oxide (NM-110) nanomaterials or carbon nanotubes (NM-401). For a core group of NMs, NM-212, NM-100, NM-101, NM- 103 and NM-220, the MTT assay was also performed in 24 h exposed cells. In addition, the batch dispersions and their dilutions in the cell medium were analyzed by dynamic light scattering (DLS). Findings: The size distribution of the dispersions showed that in general the NMs showed peaks around 100 nm, but a multimodal size-distribution was observed for NM-103, NM-200, NM-302 and NM-401. Considering the PE assay, NM-212, NM-101, NM-110, silicon dioxides and both silver NMs were cytotoxic. On the contrary, NM-100, NM-103 and NM-220 were not cytotoxic. In the MTT assay following 24h- exposure to the core NMs, no significant cytotoxicity was observed. Conclusion & Significance: Overall, cytotoxicity determined in PE assay yielded positive results in the majority of the NMs, suggesting that this methodology may be more sensitive than MTT to NMs’ induced toxicity. Furthermore, long-term exposure to NMs is possibly more relevant to address health impact of NMs.
