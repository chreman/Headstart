			Rheumatoid arthritis is a common, chronic inflammatory and destructive arthropathy with considerable personal, social and economic implications. Although the etiology of rheumatoid arthritis remains controversial, the hallmark of the disease is characterized by symmetrical inflammation of the synovial membrane of freely moveable joints, massive synovial proliferation and influx of inflammatory cells. Methotrexate is the first line therapy, but in intolerant patients biologic agents should be used. The development and clinical use of highly effective biological substances for standard treatment guidelines of rheumatic conditions treatment is a health economic problem due of being exceedingly costly. Activated macrophages are critical in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis and specifically express folate receptor β, a receptor for the vitamin folic acid. This receptor allows internalization of coupled cargo to folic acid by folate receptor-mediated endocytosis. Liposomes have gained extensive attention as carriers for a wide range of therapeutic agents because of being both nontoxic and biodegradable. This work aims to exploit the potential of folate-targeted liposomal nanoparticles as effective drug delivery systems for therapies directly targeting activated macrophages, reducing long term effects in rheumatoid arthritis patients.
			Specific targeting of activated macrophages is an important research challenge because they are phagocytic cells capable of internalizing any foreign particle. A complete stealth degree is needed to avoid the clearance of nanoparticles by macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system. Chapter II reports the study of surface modification of liposomes with the glycolipid monosialoganglioside and the polymer polyethylene glycol to improve stealth and decrease their clearance. Liposomes prepared with the monosialoganglioside clearly reduced macrophage uptake, but not to the same extent as liposomes prepared with 10% polyethylene glycol which ensure a proper stealth degree of the nanoparticles.
			The preparation of folate receptor-targeted liposomes, is typically performed by covalently attaching folic acid to a phospholipid or cholesterol anchor with polyethylene glycol and subsequent incorporation in the bilayer. Although these folic acid conjugates were shown to successfully target folate receptor α, there are some concerns regarding their use, namely chemical stability and self-aggregation at the liposome surface. Chapter III describes an innovative strategy for targeted liposomal delivery that uses a hydrophobic fragment of pulmonary surfactant protein D conjugated to a linker and folic acid. The peptide conjugate inserts deeply into the lipid bilayer without affecting liposomal integrity. The novel liposomal constructs are highly stable, specific for folate receptor α – expressing cells, and promote a more efficient liposomal membrane disruption than classic systems. The capacity of targeted liposomes to encapsulate and specifically deliver either hydrophobic or hydrophilic drugs into targeted cells was also demonstrated.
			The combination of all these characteristics of the new liposomes led us to evaluate its the efficiency to treat rheumatoid arthritis, by targeting folate receptor β present at the surface of activated macrophages. Chapter IV reports the encapsulation of methotrexate in the new liposomal formulation, to enhance its tolerance and efficacy. The presence of 10% polyethylene glycol in the liposomes greatly improved the stealth degree, promoting the specificity of folic acid-mediated targeting. Liposomes strongly accumulated in the joints of arthritic mice, demonstrating their specificity in vivo. Furthermore, this liposomal formulation significantly increases the clinical benefit and complete prophylactic efficacy of methotrexate in an animal model.
			Chapter V reports a preliminary study on the use of the optimized liposome nanoparticles as siRNA carriers. Myeloid cell leukaemia-1 protein is essential for synovial macrophage survival. This study demonstrated that neutral liposomal formulation derived from DOPE phospholipid ensures that siRNAs molecules, are encapsulated inside the core of the liposomes with high polyethylene glycol content, reducing the toxicity associated to cationic liposomes.
			Chapter VI describe the establishments of a method to assess the disruption of nanoparticle drug delivery system in vitro using Hoechst 34580 a DNA binding dye, as a drug mimicker. This approach enables to correlate the intensity of a fluorescent dye with the nanoparticle disruption and consequent drug delivery in the cytoplasm of the cell.
			In summary, this work reports the use of liposomes prepared with a novel peptide conjugate for folic acid-mediated delivery, what creates new opportunities for the treatment of human diseases, namely rheumatoid arthritis and cancer.
			A artrite reumatoide é uma artropatia inflamatória crónica comum e destrutiva, com consideráveis implicações pessoais, sociais e económicas. Embora a etiologia da artrite reumatoide permaneça controversa, a doença é caracterizada por inflamação simétrica da membrana sinovial de articulações móveis, intensa proliferação sinovial e influxo de células inflamatórias. O metotrexato é a terapia de primeira linha mas, em doentes intolerantes, devem ser usados agentes biológicos. O desenvolvimento e uso clínico de agentes biológicos altamente efetivos nas diretrizes de tratamento padrão de doenças reumáticas é um problema económico de saúde por serem altamente dispendiosos. Deste modo, estratégias mais eficazes têm de ser identificadas. Os macrófagos ativados têm papel vital na patogénese da artrite reumatoide e tem sido demonstrado que expressam especificamente o recetor de folato β, o recetor para a vitamina ácido fólico. Este recetor permite a internalização de ácido fólico acoplado a carga por endocitose. Os lipossomas são altamente atrativos como transportadores de vários agentes terapêuticos por serem não tóxicos e biodegradáveis. Este trabalho visa explorar o potencial dos lipossomas com folato como um sistema de libertação de fármacos eficaz para terapias direcionadas diretamente para macrófagos ativados, reduzindo efeitos a longo prazo em pacientes com artrite reumatoide.
			O direcionamento específico de macrófagos ativados é um importante desafio na investigação, porque estas células fagocíticas são capazes de internalizar qualquer partícula estranha. É necessário um grau de invisibilidade total, para evitar a remoção das nanopartículas por macrófagos do sistema reticuloendotelial. O Capítulo II reporta o estudo da modificação da superfície de lipossomas com o glicolípido monossialogangliosídeo e o polímero polietileno glicol para aumentar o grau de invisibilidade e diminuir a sua remoção. Os lipossomas preparados com o monossialogangliosídeo apresentam uma reduzida remoção pelos macrófagos, contudo não com a mesma extensão que lipossomas preparados com 10% de polietileno glicol, o qual assegura um grau de invisibilidade adequado nestas nanopartículas.
			A preparação de lipossomas direcionados para recetores de folato envolve normalmente a ligação covalente do ácido fólico a uma âncora de fosfolípido ou colesterol com polietileno glicol e sua incorporação na bicamada. Embora estes conjugados de folato tenham mostrado direcionar o vetor para o recetor de folato α, existem algumas preocupações subjacentes ao seu uso, nomeadamente estabilidade química e auto-agregação na superfície do lipossoma. O Capítulo III descreve uma estratégia inovadora para o direcionamento lipossomal que utiliza um fragmento hidrofóbico de proteína surfactante pulmonar D conjugada a um ligante e ácido fólico. O conjugado peptídico insere-se profundamente na bicamada lipídica sem afetar a integridade lipossomal. Estas novas construções são altamente estáveis, específicas para células que expressam o recetor de folato α e promovem a rutura da membrana lipossomal de forma mais eficiente do que o sistema clássico. Além disso, foi também demonstrada a capacidade destes lipossomas para encapsular e libertar especificamente nas células-alvo tanto fármacos hidrofóbicos como hidrofílicos.
			A combinação de todas estas características dos novos lipossomas levou-nos a avaliar a sua eficácia para o tratamento de artrite reumatoide, por direcionamento do recetor de folato β, presente na superfície de macrófagos ativados. O Capítulo IV relata o encapsulamento do metotrexato na nova formulação lipossomal para melhorar a sua tolerância e eficácia. A presença de 10% de polietileno glicol nos lipossomas melhorou significativamente o grau de invisibilidade, promovendo a especificidade de direcionamento mediada pelo ácido fólico. Os lipossomas acumulam-se fortemente nas articulações de ratinhos com artrite, demonstrando a sua especificidade in vivo. Além disso, esta formulação lipossomal aumenta significativamente o benefício clínico e apresenta uma total eficácia profilática do metotrexato num modelo animal.
			O Capítulo V reporta um estudo preliminar sobre a utilização dos lipossomas como transportadores de siRNA. A proteína myeloid cell leukaemia-1 é essencial para a sobrevivência de macrófagos do sinóvio. Este estudo demonstra que é possível utilizar uma formulação lipossomal neutra derivada do fosfolípido DOPE assegurando que os siRNAs são encapsulados no interior central dos lipossomas com concentração elevada de polietileno glicol, reduzindo a toxicidade associada aos lipossomas catiónicos.
			O Capítulo VI descreve o estabelecimento de um método para avaliar a disrupção de lipossomas como sistemas de libertação de fármacos in vitro, utilizando o Hoechst 34580, um corante que se liga ao DNA, para simular o fármaco. Esta abordagem permite correlacionar a intensidade de um corante fluorescente com a rutura das nanopartículas e consequente libertação da droga no citoplasma da célula.
			Em resumo, este trabalho reporta a utilização de lipossomas preparados com o novo conjugado peptídico, para direcionamento mediada por ácido fólico, abrindo novas oportunidades para o tratamento de doenças humanas, como artrite reumatoide e cancro.

			The development of nanodevices for clinical use brings new hope for current medicine due to the possibility to improve the efficiency
			of drug delivery. Many pharmacological compounds present characteristics, such as their quick degradation, water insolubility and
			significant toxicity, that prevent a simple mode of administration. Therefore, nanodevices are exploited to carry drugs from the site
			of administration to the therapeutic target site. Although in the last decades several innovative nanodevices have been developed,
			protein-based nanodevices have raised substantial interest. Albumin is the most abundant plasma protein and is involved in important
			physiological functions. Moreover, albumin’s availability, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and its lack of toxicity and
			immunogenicity, are all important factors in nanodevice development.
			Albumin-based nanoparticles present several advantages as drug carriers: the presence of reactive groups on their surface allows
			surface modification; a high content of charged amino acids allows the electrostatic adsorption of charged molecules; represent a
			promising strategy for cancer therapy due to their enhanced uptake in solid tumors mediated by albumin-binding proteins, and due
			to the hypoalbuminemia commonly observed in cancer patients.
			The aim of this work is the development of albumin-based nanoparticles as drug delivery systems (DDS), mainly for cancer therapy.
			High pressure homogenization, a high-energy emulsification method, was explored as it presents several advantages. This work
			reports the optimization of this method for the production of albumin-based nanoparticles suitable for intravenous administration,
			here designated nanoemulsions taking into account the production method. After several steps of optimization, stable nanoemulsions
			of small, defined and controllable size were obtained. The addition of a tri-block copolymer, Poloxamer 407, which presents
			poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains in its composition, allowed the regulation of nanoparticle size and of its surface characteristics.
			Molecular dynamic simulation and the fluorescent tagging of the Poloxamer 407 were used to better understand the interactions
			between the different components of the system and their mechanistic role on the size of nanoparticles. The results demonstrated
			that the hydrophobic part of Poloxamer 407 interacts preferably with the oil, decreasing hydrophobic interactions between oil and
			protein, which may be responsible for size reduction. Additionally, it was observed that albumin and Poloxamer 407 interact forming
			a matrix surrounding the oil. The biological characterization of the nanoemulsions proved that they do not induce cytotoxicity nor
			oxidative stress in normal human cells. Folic acid (FA)-tagged nanoemulsions were produced and were shown to achieve specific
			folate receptor (FR)-mediated targeting in FR positive cells. The entrapment of different pharmacological drugs in nanoemulsions
			was also tested and successful incorporation, mainly of hydrophobic compounds, was observed.
			As the addition of Poloxamer 407 also affects nanoemulsions’ surface characteristics, the stealth degree was studied in the presence
			of different concentrations of this PEGylated surfactant. The internalization of the PEGylated nanoparticles by activated macrophages
			was assessed and the results demonstrated that nanoparticles containing the highest concentration of surfactant (5 mg/mL) were
			less phagocytosed. Thus, this formulation can generate stealth nanoemulsions with improved blood circulation time and
			biodistribution.
			Functionalized albumin nanoemulsions were produced through the incorporation of chemically modified albumin in the initial
			formulation for nanoemulsion production. Albumin-drug/targeting agent conjugates were developed using different coupling
			methods. The functionalized nanoemulsions efficiently delivered drugs and mediated specific cell targeting in vitro. The
			nanoemulsions suitable characteristics, small size and PEGylated surface, may help overcome problems associated with free drugs
			therapies, improving their therapeutic efficiency.
			FA-tagged albumin nanoemulsions were loaded with carbon monoxide releasing molecule-2 (CORM-2), a hydrophobic compound
			that present anti-proliferative capacity against cancer cells. The biological effects of these nanoemulsions were tested both in vitro
			and in vivo. The results showed the selective delivery of CORM-2 into A20 B-cell lymphoma cells (FR positive cells). Their therapeutic
			efficacy was also observed in BALB/c mice bearing subcutaneous A20 lymphoma tumors through considerable tumor growth
			inhibition as well as a substantial increase of mice survival. These albumin-based nanoemulsions were well tolerated by the
			immunocompetent mice.
			In summary, albumin-based nanoparticles developed in this work evidenced that this type of nanodevices can be successfully used
			as DDS for a wide range of therapeutic applications, with an immense potential for cancer therapy application.
			O desenvolvimento de nanodispositivos para uso clínico é uma área promissora para a medicina devido à possibilidade de melhorar
			a eficiência da entrega de fármacos. Muitos compostos farmacológicos apresentam características que impedem a sua
			administração simples, tais como a sua degradação rápida, insolubilidade em solução aquosa e grande toxicidade. Assim, os
			nanodispositivos são explorados para aplicações terapêuticas pela possibilidade de transportar os fármacos desde o local de
			administração até ao local de intervenção terapêutica. Embora nas últimas décadas vários nanodispositivos originais tenham sido
			desenvolvidos, os nanodispositivos à base de proteína têm merecido particular interesse. A albumina é a proteína mais abundante
			no plasma e está envolvida em funções fisiológicas importantes. Além disso, a sua disponibilidade, biocompatibilidade,
			biodegradabilidade e ausência de toxicidade e imunogenicidade, são importantes fatores no desenvolvimento de nanodispositivos.
			As nanopartículas à base de albumina apresentam várias vantagens na veiculação de fármacos: a presença de grupos reativos à
			superfície permite a sua modificação funcional; um elevado conteúdo em aminoácidos carregados permite a adsorção electroestática
			de moléculas carregadas; representam uma estratégia promissora para a terapia do cancro devido à sua captação aumentada em
			tumores sólidos através de proteínas de ligação à albumina, e devido à hipo-albuminemia comumente observada em pacientes
			oncológicos.
			O objetivo deste trabalho é o desenvolvimento de nanopartículas à base de albumina como sistemas de entrega de droga (DDS),
			principalmente para a terapia do cancro. Neste sentido, foi explorada a homogeneização de alta pressão, um método de
			emulsificação de elevada energia, que apresenta várias vantagens. Este trabalho reporta a otimização deste método para a produção
			de nanopartículas à base de albumina adequadas para administração intravenosa, que foram designadas nanoemulsões tendo em
			conta o método de produção. Após várias etapas de otimização foram obtidas nanoemulsões estáveis de tamanho pequeno, definido
			e controlável. A adição de um copolímero tri-bloco, Poloxamer 407, que apresenta cadeias de poli(etilenoglicol) (PEG) na sua
			composição, permitiu regular o tamanho das nanopartículas e as suas características de superfície. A simulação de dinâmica
			molecular e a marcação fluorescente do Poloxamer 407 permitiram compreender melhor as interações entre os diferentes
			componentes do sistema e o seu papel mecanístico no tamanho das nanopartículas. A parte hidrofóbica do Poloxamer 407 interage
			preferencialmente com o óleo, diminuindo as interações hidrofóbicas entre óleo e proteína, o que poderá ser responsável pela
			redução de tamanho. Adicionalmente, observou-se que a albumina e o Poloxamer 407 interagem formando uma matriz em torno
			do óleo. A caracterização biológica das nanoemulsões demonstrou que elas não induzem citotoxicidade nem stress oxidativo em
			células humanas normais. Foram produzidas nanoemulsões funcionalizadas com ácido fólico (FA) que demonstraram
			direcionamento específico mediado pelo recetor de folato (FR) em células positivas para este recetor. A incorporação de diferentes
			fármacos nas nanoemulsões também foi testado sendo particularmente eficiente com compostos hidrofóbicos.
			Uma vez que a adição de Poloxamer 407 também afeta as características de superfície das nanoemulsões, foi estudado o grau de
			“stealth” na presença de diferentes concentrações deste surfactante PEGuilado. O estudo da internalização das nanopartículas
			PEGuiladas por macrófagos ativados demonstrou que as nanopartículas contendo a concentração mais elevada de surfactante (5
			mg/mL) foram menos fagocitadas. Assim, esta formulação produz nanoemulsões “stealth” o que poderá prolongar o seu tempo de
			circulação no sangue e biodistribuição.
			Foram produzidas nanoemulsões de albumina funcionalizadas através da incorporação de albumina modificada quimicamente na
			formulação inicial para produção. Os conjugados de albumina-fármaco/agente de direcionamento foram desenvolvidos utilizando
			diferentes métodos de acoplamento. As nanoemulsões funcionalizadas revelaram eficiência na entrega de fármacos e capacidade
			de direcionamento específico in vitro. Devido às suas características adequadas, tamanho pequeno e superfície PEGuilada, estas
			nanoemulsões permitirão ultrapassar os problemas associados com terapias de fármacos livres, melhorando a eficiência
			terapêutica.
			Desenvolveram-se também nanoemulsões de albumina contendo FA e um composto hidrofóbico, a molécula libertadora de
			monóxido de carbono-2 (CORM-2), com atividade anti-proliferativa contra células de cancro. Os efeitos biológicos destas
			nanoemulsões foram testados in vitro e in vivo. Os resultados demonstraram a entrega seletiva de CORM-2 em células A20, linfoma
			de células B (células que expressam o FR). A eficácia terapêutica foi também verificada em ratinhos BALB/c portadores de tumores
			de linfoma subcutâneos pela inibição considerável do crescimento tumoral e aumento substancial da sobrevivência dos ratinhos.
			Foi também observado que estas nanoemulsões à base de albumina foram bem toleradas por ratinhos imunocompetentes.
			Em conclusão, as nanoparticulas à base de albumina desenvolvidas neste trabalho evidenciaram que este tipo de nanodispositivos
			pode ser utilizado com sucesso como DDS para uma ampla gama de aplicações terapêuticas, com um imenso potencial para
			aplicação na terapia do cancro.

Active targeting for cells has explored specific modification of the liposome surface by functionalizing it with specific targeting ligands in order to increase accumulation and intracellular uptake into target cells. None of the Food and Drug Administration-licensed liposomes or lipid nanoparticles are coated with ligands or target moieties to delivery for homing drugs to target tissues, cells or subcellular organelles. Targeted therapies (with or without controlled drug release) are an emerging and relevant research area. Despite of the numerous liposomes reviews published in the last decades, this area is in constant development. Updates urgently needed to integrate new advances in targeted liposomes research. This review highlights the evolution of liposomes from passive to active targeting and challenges in the development of targeted liposomes for specific therapies.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of neutral liposomes containing polyethylene glycol (PEG) to encapsulate siRNA in their aqueous core. This formulation will reduce drastically the toxicity associated to cationic liposomes by bringing surface charge to almost zero, increasing stealth degree and therefore circulation time. In this study, we evaluate the efficiency of folate-targeted liposomes for specific delivery of siRNA to activated macrophages, key effector cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathology which specifically express folate receptor  (FR). Myeloid cell leukaemia-1 (Mcl-1) is a protein essential for synovial macrophage survival, since Mcl-1 suppression results in the induction of apoptosis. The effect of MCL1 siRNA incorporated in liposomal formulation was assessed in primary human macrophages and successful inhibition of Mcl-1 expression was achieved. Here we show that the neutral liposomal derived from DOPE (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine) formulation developed is efficient to encapsulate MCL1 siRNA and silencing gene expression in activated human macrophages.

			This study shows for the first time the sonochemical preparation of HSA nanocapsules avoiding toxic cross linking chemicals and emulsifiers used in other methods.

			Production of HSA nanocapsules was optimized leading to a diameter of 443.5 ± 9.0 nm and a narrow size distribution indicated by a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.066 ± 0.080. Nanocapsules were surface modified with folic acid (FA) and the FA content was determined to be 0.38 and 6.42 molecules FA per molecule HSA, depending on the surplus of FA employed. Dynamic light scattering was used to determine size, PDI and zetapotential of the produced nanocapsules before and after surface modification. FA distribution on the surface of HSA nanocapsules was localized three-dimensionally after fluorescence labeling using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Furthermore, specific binding and internalization of HSA nanocapsules by FRβ-positive and FRβ-negative macrophages, obtained from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, was demonstrated by flow cytometry. FRβ-expressing macrophages showed an increased binding for FA-modified capsules compared with those without FA.

Carbon monoxide releasing molecule-2 (CORM-2) was incorporated in the oil phase of the initial formulation. FA-functionalized nanoemulsions loaded with CORM-2 exhibited a considerable antitumor effect and an increased survival of BALB/c mice bearing subcutaneous A20 lymphoma tumors. The developed nanoemulsions also demonstrated to be well tolerated by these immunocompetent mice. Thus, the results obtained in this study demonstrate that FA-tagged protein nanoemulsions can be successfully used in cancer therapy, with the important ability to delivery drugs intracellularly.

Although the cause of RA remains unknown, the complex interaction between immune mediators (cytokines and effector cells) is responsible for the joint damage that begins at the synovial membrane. Activated macrophages are critical in the pathogenesis of RA and have been shown to specifically express a receptor for the vitamin folic acid (FA), folate receptor  (FR). This particular receptor allows internalization of FA-coupled cargo. In this review we will address the potential of nanoparticles as an effective drug delivery system for therapies that will directly target activated macrophages. Special attention will be given to stealth degree of the nanoparticles as a strategy to avoid clearance by macrophages of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS). This review summarizes the application of FA-target nanoparticles as drug delivery systems for RA and proposes prospective future directions.

Directed folate receptor targeting using liposomes is usually achieved using folate linked to a phospholipid or cholesterol anchor. This link is formed using a large spacer like polyethylene glycol. Here, we report an innovative strategy for targeted liposome delivery that uses a hydrophobic fragment of surfactant protein D linked to folate. Our proposed spacer is a small 4 amino acid residue linker. The peptide conjugate inserts deeply into the lipid bilayer without affecting liposomal integrity, with high stability and specificity. To compare the drug delivery potential of both liposomal targeting systems, we encapsulated the nuclear dye Hoechst 34580. The eventual increase in blue fluorescence would only be detectable upon liposome disruption, leading to specific binding of this dye to DNA. Our delivery system was proven to be more efficient (2-fold) in Caco-2 cells than classic systems where the folate moiety is linked to liposomes by polyethylene glycol.

Although the newest data show that in the steady state resident macrophages of many organs are monocyte independent, blood monocytes critically contribute to tissue macrophage and DC pools upon inflammation. To better understand the relationship between these populations and their phenotype, we isolated and differentiated human blood CD14+ monocytes in vitro into immature and mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) as well as into seven different monocyte-derived macrophage subsets. We used the panel of 70 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) submitted to the 10th Human Leukocyte Differentiation Antigen Workshop to determine the expression profiles of these 10 populations by flow cytometry. We now can compile subpanels of mAbs to differentiate the 10 monocyte/macrophage/MoDC subsets, providing the basis for novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools.","228827","Open Access","0.6751","-0.3712","2","Original article","Original article","7","132","14","",""

However, their conventional production involves several reaction steps including chemical modification and activation of both proteins followed by cross-linking often involving toxic chemicals. Here, we describe the enzymatic synthesis of mAb-HSA conjugates for targeted drug delivery devices using tyrosinase from Agaricus bisporus under mild reaction conditions (pH 6.8, 25 [degree]C). Reaction conditions were optimized by using fluorescence labeled HSA to facilitate SDS-PAGE analysis with fluorescence scanning. Enzymatic cross-linking in the presence of natural low molecular weight phenolic compounds (e.g. caffeic acid) resulted in reaction products in the molecular weight range of [similar]216 kDa, corresponding to mAb-HSA conjugates. The composition of the conjugates was confirmed with tryptic digestion followed by LC-MS/MS analysis of the resulting peptide fragments. Successful binding of mAb-HSA conjugates (in contrast to free HSA) to MHC II molecules, located on antigen-presenting cells, was demonstrated by both ELISA and flow cytometry analysis.

Liposomes were coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and brain-tissue-derived monosialoganglioside (GM1). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) nanoparticles were produced incorporating a PEGylated surfactant (PEG-surfactant). All obtained nanoparticles were monodisperse, with sizes ranging from 80 to 120 nm, with a zeta-potential close to zero. The presented stealth strategies lead to a decrease of internalization levels by macrophages. These surface modified nanoparticles could be used for production of new drug delivery nanosystems for systemic administration (e.g. intravenous application).

It consists of a syndrome of pain, stiffness and symmetrical inflammation of the synovial membrane (synovitis) of freely moveable joints such as the knee (diarthrodial joints). Although the etiology of rheumatoid arthritis is unclear, the disease is characterized by inflammation of the synovial lining of diarthrodial joints, high synovial proliferation and an influx of inflammatory cells, macrophages and lymphocytes through angiogenic blood vessels. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs slow disease progression and can induce disease remission in some patients. Methotrexate is the first line therapy, but if patients become intolerant to this drug, biologic agents should be used. The development of biological substances for the treatment of rheumatic conditions has been accompanied by ongoing health economic discussions regarding the implementation of these highly effective, but accordingly, highly priced drugs are the standard treatment guidelines of rheumatic diseases. In this way, more efficient strategies have to be identified. Despite numerous reviews in rheumatoid arthritis in the last years, this area is in constant development and updates are an urgent need to incorporate new advances in rheumatoid arthritis research. This review highlights the immunopathogenesis rationale for the current therapeutic strategies in rheumatoid arthritis.

Different nanodevices have been developed in recent years, among them protein-based nanoparticles which have gained considerable interest. Albumin is a versatile protein carrier with several characteristics that make it an ideal candidate for drug delivery, such as its availability, its biocompatibility, its biodegradability, and its lack of toxicity and immunogenicity. This review embodies an overview of different methods available for production of albumin-based nanoparticles, with focus on high-energy emulsification methods. A comparison between production by using sonication, which involves acoustic cavitation, and the high pressure homogenization method, where occurs hydrodynamic cavitation, is presented. Taking into account important properties of nanoparticles required for intravenous administration, the use of poloxamers, tri-block copolymer surfactants is discussed as it improves blood circulation time and bioavailability of nanoparticles. Thus, nanoparticles can be engineered to provide adequate features to therapeutic applications, in which can be included surface functionalization with targeting agents. Different albumin-based formulations and their therapeutic applications are presented in this review, with emphasis on applications in cancer therapy, where albumin-based strategies are promising for targeted drug delivery in innovative clinical strategies.
