			The First Workshop on Personalised Multilingual Hypertext Retrieval (PMHR 2011)
			was held on the 6th June 2011 in conjunction with the 22nd ACM conference on Hypertext and Hypermedia in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. The aims of PMHR 2011 were to promote collaboration and the exchange of ideas between researchers working on hypertext and adaptive hypertexts, cross-lingual information retrieval, personalised search, personalisation for the web and hypertexts, and recommender systems. The workshop had a specific focus on research in user modelling and multilingual personalisation for hypertext retrieval.
