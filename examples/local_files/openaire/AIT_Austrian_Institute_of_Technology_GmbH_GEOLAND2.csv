It is a good measure of the amount of active vegetation and it is linked to canopy conductance, water and carbon fluxes at the interface between the atmosphere and the vegetation. In this study, we compare four different estimates of LAI over France: two LAI products derived from visible remote sensing, and simulated LAI from two land surface models. The simulated LAI is produced by the ISBA-A-gs model (developped by CNRM) and by the ORCHIDEE model (developped by LSCE). The same atmospheric forcing is used by two models: the SAFRAN dataset, a high resolution (8-km) operational product over France. The same vegetation map is used: the ECOCLIMAP2 dataset. The LAI remote sensing products are: MODIS (Collection 5), derived from the MODIS sensors, and CYCLOPES, derived from the SPOT4/VEGETATION sensor. These products were re-projected on the grid used by the model. The study period ranges from 2000 to 2007 and allows to study the average seasonal cycle as well as the interannual variation of LAI. We analyse monthly values of LAI over the period. The average seasonal cycle over the seven years starts earlier in the ORCHIDEE simulations than in the ISBA-A-gs ones. ORCHIDEE simulates a maximum interannual variability of LAI in spring (and a small one in summer), whereas in the ISBA-A-gs simulation the maximum is in summer (with small values in spring). These differences can be explained by contrasting levels of phenology constraints used in the two models. The interannual variability of both satellite products is more complex, with a weaker seasonal cycle and contrasted spatial patterns. Finally, we compare the water and carbon fluxes simulated by the two models.","218795","Closed Access","-0.2721","-0.0992","8","Root water, Water uptake, Soil moisture","Root water, Water uptake, Soil moisture",NA,NA,NA,"",""

These estimates are difficult to obtain due to the limited number of weather stations that measure this variable. In the present study, we validated the global radiation estimates derived from MeteoSat Second Generation (MSG) and evaluated their use in the European Crop Growth Monitoring System (CGMS). A validation with measurements from four CarboEurope flux towers showed that the MSG estimates are accurate and unbiased (standard deviation between 30 and 51 W/m2). Moreover, a comparison with global radiation estimates from about 300 operational weather stations throughout Europe confirmed that the quality of the MSG product is high and spatially uniform. We also made an intercomparison between the MSG product and the ECMWF (ERA-INTERIM) and CGMS products at 25 km resolution, thus demonstrating that the CGMS and ECMWF products generally underestimate radiation. Nevertheless, the CGMS product showed irregular spatial patterns of local over- and underestimation, while the ECMWF product consistently underestimated. A trend analysis using a seasonal Mann-Kendall test between 2005 and 2009 did not reveal any significant monotonic trends in the MSG radiation estimates, except for 1 location out of 15. Finally, when we applied the WOFOST crop model for maize throughout Europe, the simulated potential total biomass increased due to higher estimates of global radiation made by MSG. In contrast, the water-limited simulated total-biomass generally decreased due to a higher reference evapotranspiration, causing faster depletion of soil moisture and increased water stress.","218795","Open Access","-0.6008","-0.2239","1","Fcover global, Capitalizing over existing, Essential climate variables","Fcover global, Capitalizing over existing, Essential climate variables","15",NA,NA,"",""

Detailed crop type maps over the period 2000-2009 were used to derive time-series of crop-specific GAI by selecting only those 250m MODIS pixels that have at least 75% purity for the target crop. Two important model parameters where optimized by minimizing the difference between simulated and observed GAI for each individual pixel and year. The resulting year-specific  joint parameter distributions were used to run an ensemble of crop simulations where the ensemble was initialized by sampling from the joint distribution of the corresponding year. The semi-variograms of the retrieved parameters demonstrate that the spatial patterns are consistent with agricultural practices, while seasonal characteristics of weather patterns in Wallonia can, at least partially, explain the temporal variability in the retrieved parameter distributions. Finally, the average ensemble crop simulation results were aggregated to the level of provinces and regions. A validation with EUROSTAT reported yields over the period 2000—2009 demonstrates that the assimilation of MODIS GAI leads to an improved relationship between simulation results and reported yields at regional level.","218795","Open Access","-0.4249","-0.5503","11","Crop","Crop","40",NA,NA,"",""

The strategy follows the recommendations of the CEOS/WGCV Land Product Validation for LAI global products validation. Several criteria of performance were evaluated, including continuity, spatial and temporal consistency, dynamic range of retrievals, statistical analysis per biome type, precision and accuracy. The spatial and temporal consistencies of GEOV1 products were assessed by intercomparison with reference global products (MODIS c5, CYCLOPES v3.1, GLOBCARBON v2 LAI, and JRC SeaWIFS FAPAR) over a global network of homogeneous sites (BELMANIP-2) during the 2003-2005 period. The accuracy of GEOV1 was evaluated against a number of available ground reference maps. Our results show that GEOV1 products present reliable spatial distribution, smooth temporal profiles which are stable from year to year, good dynamic range with reliable magnitude for bare areas and dense forests, and optimal performances with ground-based maps. GEOV1 outperforms the quality of reference global products in most of the examined criteria, and constitutes a step forward in the development of consistent and accurate global biophysical variables within the context of the land monitoring core service of GMES.","218795","Open Access","-0.4495","0.2321","1","Fcover global, Capitalizing over existing, Essential climate variables","Fcover global, Capitalizing over existing, Essential climate variables","85",NA,NA,"",""

The availability of numerous products creates a need to understand the level of consistency between products, and reasons for inconsistencies. We evaluate the consistency of six FAPAR products (MODIS, MODIS7TIP, SeaWIFS, MERIS, SPOT-VEG, and AVHRR) across the Australian continent, using multi-year records. We find that seemingly large differences in FAPAR products over much of Australia can be explained by a simple offset present in certain products. Additional inconsistencies arise from different sensitivities in FAPAR to changes in vegetation cover. These inconsistencies can in turn be partially attributed to changes in biome type that are relevant to certain products and other model specific assumptions. The satellite FAPAR products are compared with a dataset of observation-based estimates of fractional vegetation cover at ~600 field sites across Australia. After accounting  for  offsets  in  FAPAR,  relatively  high  agreement  occurs  at  sites classified as grasslands, shrublands and managed land (agriculture). Significant disagreement occurs at sites correctly classified as forests. Consequently,  some products  show  significant  differences  in  FAPAR  between  regions  of  similar vegetation  cover  but  different  biome  classification. We  find  that  all  products show a much lower sensitivity to fractional vegetation cover (range in coefficient of linear regression: 0.28-0.61) than is predicted theoretically (0.9671.18) using a canopy  radiative  transfer  model  directly  estimating  the  absorbtion  of photosynthetically active radiation by  vegetation.

			Land-surface modelling would benefit significantly from improved characterisation of the seasonal variability of vegetation at a global scale. GEOCLIM, a global climatology of leaf area index (LAI), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR)—both essential climate variables—and fraction of vegetation cover (FCOVER), is here derived from observations from the SPOT VEGETATION programme. Interannual average values from the GEOV1 Copernicus Global Land time series of biophysical products at 1-km resolution and 10-day frequency are computed for 1999 to 2010. GEOCLIM provides the baseline characteristics of the seasonal cycle of the annual vegetation phenology for each 1-km pixel on the globe. The associated standard deviation characterises the interannual variability. Temporal consistency and continuity is achieved by the accumulation of multi-year observations and the application of techniques for temporal smoothing and gap filling. Specific corrections are applied over cloudy tropical regions and high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere where the low number of available observations compromises the reliability of estimates. Artefacts over evergreen broadleaf forests and areas of bare soil are corrected based on the expected limited seasonality. The GEOCLIM data set is demonstrated to be consistent, both spatially and temporally. GEOCLIM shows absolute differences lower than 0.5 compared with MODIS (GIMMS3g) climatology of LAI for more than 80% (90%) of land pixels, with higher discrepancies in tropical and boreal latitudes. ECOCLIMAP systematically produces higher LAI values. The phenological metric for the date of maximum foliar development derived from GEOCLIM is spatially consistent (correlation higher than 0.9) with those of MODIS, GIMMS3g, ECOCLIMAP and MCD12Q2 with average differences within 14 days at the global scale.","610028","Open Access","-0.1292","0.2884","15","Spot vegetation","Spot vegetation","12",NA,NA,"",""

The phenological metrics were calibrated over an ensemble of ground observations of the timing of leaf unfolding and autumnal colouring of leaves.

The spatial patterns of the derived LAI phenology agreed well with those from MODIS-EVI and -NDVI, although the timing of the start, end, and length of season differed by about one month at the global scale, with higher uncertainties in areas of limited seasonality of the satellite signal and systematic biases due to the differences in the methodologies and datasets.

Leaf Area Index (LAI) is a structure variable giving a measure of the canopysurface for radiation interception and canopy-atmosphere interactions. LAI is an important variable in manyecosystem models and it has been recognized as an Essential Climate Variable. This thesis aims to provide globaland continuous estimates of LAI from satellite observations in near-real time according to user requirements to beused for diagnostic and prognostic evaluations of vegetation state and functioning. There are already someavailable LAI products which show however some important discrepancies in terms of magnitude and somelimitations in terms of continuity and consistency. This thesis addresses these important issues. First, the nature ofthe LAI estimated from these satellite observations was investigated to address the existing differences in thedefinition of products. Then, different temporal smoothing and gap filling methods were analyzed to reduce noiseand discontinuities in the time series mainly due to cloud cover. Finally, different methods for near real timeestimation of LAI were evaluated. Such comparison assessment as a function of the level of noise and gaps werelacking for LAI.Results achieved within the first part of the thesis show that the effective LAI is more accurately retrievedfrom satellite data than the actual LAI due to leaf clumping in the canopies. Further, the study has demonstratedthat multi-view observations provide only marginal improvements on LAI retrieval. The study also found that foroptimal retrievals the size of the uncertainty envelope over a set of possible solutions to be approximately equal tothat in the reflectance measurements. The results achieved in the second part of the thesis found the method withlocally adaptive temporal window, depending on amount of available observations and Climatology as backgroundestimation to be more robust to noise and missing data for smoothing, gap-filling and near real time estimationswith satellite time series.; Le suivi des variables biophysiques à l’échelle globale sur de longues périodes de temps est essentiellepour répondre aux nouveaux enjeux que constituent le changement climatique et la sécurité alimentaire.

Puis, différentes méthodes de lissage te bouchage des séries temporelles ont été analysées pour réduire le bruit et les discontinuités principalement liées à la couverture nuageuse.

A sensitivity analysis is conducted here by using the WRF atmospheric model and the ORCHIDEE land-surface model over France with (1) a prescribed vegetation corresponding to year 2002 and (2) a dynamical vegetation model that leaves the vegetation freely evolving. It has been found that, accounting for the phenology dynamics has opposite effects on both events, it damps the temperature anomaly in June, while it amplifies the temperature anomaly in August. The evolution of leaf area index in the two simulations reveals the early and fast development of agricultural vegetation in the simulation with freely evolving vegetation. The vegetation also decays earlier in 2003 than during normal years. This behavior has two consequences. In June, the larger foliage development, caused by higher springtime insolation, contributes to enhanced evapotranspiration and therefore land surface cooling which limit the temperature anomaly during the heat wave. This effect is not as visible in mountainous regions where the presence of forest and the absence of agriculture do not lead to the same modulation of the local water cycle. In August, the early leave fall and the critical soil moisture stress contribute to largely suppress evapotranspiration and to enhance sensible heat flux thus amplifying the temperature anomaly. The modulation of the temperature anomaly caused by the effect of interactive vegetation phenology can reach 1.5C for an average total anomaly of about 8C (i.e. 20%). © 2012.

Just recently, VEGETATION-derived GEOV1 biophysical products (LAI, FAPAR, and FCOVER) became available for the scientific community and were evaluated in this study for semi-arid forests in the Dry Chaco ecoregion, Argentina. Indirect validation with the MODIS-derived biophysical products (MOD15A2) shows a very good temporal consistency between both products for the period 2000-2011, with a remarkably smooth behaviour of the GEOV1 products. A good relationship between both products was found in the regression analysis with an R-2 of 0.826 and 0.724 for LAI and FAPAR, respectively. Using direct validation with digital hemispherical photography (DHP) and ceptometer ground measurements, a relatively small RMSE (RMSELAI approximate to 0.31 and RMSEFAPAR approximate to 0.11) was found. The novel PASTIS-57 technique, which can derive continuous plant area index (PAI) estimates from light transmittance measurements, shows a similar temporal profile to the GEOV1 LAI product with a relatively high but constant offset for the dry forest study sites and a nearly identical profile for the deforested site (R-2=0.86). Overall, PASTIS-57, in combination with satellite-based observations, shows potentials in LAI/PAI research and ecosystem carbon studies in general, but more ground measurements taken over multiple growing seasons and vegetation types are required to confirm these findings.","218795","Closed Access","-0.5538","0.2634","1","Fcover global, Capitalizing over existing, Essential climate variables","Fcover global, Capitalizing over existing, Essential climate variables","4",NA,NA,"",""

In recent years, numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have become an interesting source of weather data with the potential to replace observed weather data. This is a result of the steadily decreasing NWP grid sizes and the availability of long and consistent time-series through the so-called reanalysis projects. We evaluated the ERA-INTERIM reanalysis data set from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting for regional crop yield forecasting. Crop simulations were carried out using 2 identical model implementations: one using interpolated observed weather, the other using weather data derived from ERA-INTERIM. Output for both sources of weather variables was generated for the EU27 and neighbouring countries and 14 crops, aggregated to national level and validated using reported crop yields from the European Statistical Office. The results indicate that the system performs very similar in terms of crop yield forecasting skill for both sources of weather variables. In 38% of the crop–country combinations, the forecasting error can be reduced by more than 10% of the baseline forecast (the trend only) for both sources of weather variables. In almost 20% of the crop–country combinations, the forecasting error can be reduced by more than 25% of the baseline forecast. The results demonstrate that the ERA-INTERIM data set is highly suitable for regional crop yield forecasting over Europe and may be used for implementing regional crop forecasting over data-sparse regions. Finally, we conclude that there is a need to improve the crop calendar and/or calibration for some of the modelled crops","218795","Open Access","-0.2746","-0.6956","11","Crop","Crop","22",NA,"43","",""

To date, a number of LAI datasets have been developed based on time series of medium resolution optical remote sensing observations. Global validation exercises show the high value of these datasets, but at the same time they point out shortcomings, particularly in the presence of persistent cloud coverage and dense vegetation. For regional modeling studies, the choice of an ideal LAI input dataset is not straightforward as global validation, and intercomparison studies do not necessarily allow conclusions on data quality at regional scale. This paper provides a comprehensive relative intercomparison of four freely available LAI products for a wide gradient of ecosystems in Africa. The region of investigation, West Africa, comprises typical African sub-humid to arid landscapes. The selected LAI time series are the Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre-VEGETATION (SPOT-VGT)-based Carbon Cycle and Change in Land Observational Products from an Ensemble of Satellites (CYCLOPES) LAI, the SPOT-VGT-based Bio-geophysical Parameters (BioPar) LAI product GEOV1, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product MOD15A2, and the Meteosat-SEVIRI-based Satellite Application Facility on Land Surface Analysis (LSA-SAF) LAI. The comparative analyses focus on data gap occurrence, on the consistency of temporal LAI profiles, on their ability to adequately reproduce the phenological cycle and on the plausibility of LAI magnitudes for major land cover types in West Africa. A detailed quantitative validation of the LAI datasets, however, was not possible due to insufficient ground LAI measurements in the study region.","218795","Open Access","-0.2406","0.1721","3","Lai à","Lai à","11","1","31","",""

The reliability of its estimation depends on the detection of predominantly frozen conditions of the landscape (including soil and vegetation) and the presence of wet snow, which would otherwise impede the estimation. As the robust determination of the freeze/thaw (F/T) state using exclusively scatterometer measurements on a global basis is complicated due to the myriad of different climatic and land cover conditions; we propose to support the retrieval using ERA Interim temperature data. The approach is based on a probabilistic time series model, whereby backscatter and temperature data are combined to estimate the freeze/thaw state. The method is assessed with proxy F/T states derived from modeled and in situ air and soil temperature data on a global basis. These analyses show an improved consistency compared to a previously published ASCAT F/T algorithm, with typical agreements between the external data and the results of the algorithm exceeding 80%. The quantitative interpretation of these comparisons is, however, hampered by discrepancies between the F/T state derived from temperature data and the one pertinent to radar remote sensing, as the former does not account for, e.g., wet snow conditions. The inclusion of the ERA Interim temperature data can improve the accuracy of the algorithm by more than 10 percentage points in regions where freezing conditions are rare.","218795","Open Access","0.4164","0.0692","14","Ascat soil, Temperature data, Soil moisture","Ascat soil, Temperature data, Soil moisture","11",NA,NA,"",""

First, all class definitions were decomposed in terms of four vegetation parameters (type, height, density, and composition), considered as critical in indicating unconformities between LUCAS and the WWF Hellas map; their inter-class relations were described in a table of correspondence. Then, a two-tier methodology was applied: an “automated” process, where thematic agreement was based exclusively on the main land cover attribute of LUCAS (LC1); and a “supervised” process, where thematic agreement was based on the reinterpretation of LUCAS ground photos and use of ancillary earth observation imagery; non-square error matrix was deployed in both processes. For the supervised process specifically, a decision-tree was designed, using the critical vegetation parameters (mentioned above) as quantified criteria, thus allowing objective labelling of testing points in both systems. The results show that only a small proportion of the reassessed points verified the WWF Hellas map predictions and that the overall accuracy of the supervised process was reduced compared to that of the automated process. In conclusion, the LUCAS point database was found to be supportive, but not fully efficient, for identifying the various sources of error in country-scale land cover maps derived with remote sensing. Synergy with very high resolution satellite images and air photos, or a dedicated ground truth campaign, seems to be inevitable in order to validate their thematic accuracy, especially in highly heterogeneous environments. In this direction, LUCAS could be used as a verification, rather than a validation, dataset.","218795","Open Access","0.1814","-0.6628","6","Combined analysis, Land cover","Combined analysis, Land cover","1","1","14","",""

We characterized the baseline phenology of the vegetation at the global scale from GEOCLIM-LAI, a global climatology of leaf area index (LAI) derived from 1-km SPOT VEGETATION time series for 1999-2010. The calibration with ground measurements showed that the start and end of season were best identified using respectively 30% and 40% threshold of LAI amplitude values. The satellite-derived phenology was spatially consistent with the global distributions of climatic drivers and biome land cover. The accuracy of the derived phenological metrics, evaluated using available ground observations for birch forests in Europe, cherry in Asia and lilac shrubs in North America showed an overall root mean square error lower than 19 days for the start, end and length of season, and good agreement between the latitudinal gradients of VEGETATION LAI phenology and ground data

However, these time series are associated with significant uncertainties and incomplete because of cloud cover. This study compares eight methods designed to improve the continuity by filling gaps and consistency by smoothing the time course. It includes methods exploiting the time series as a whole (iterative caterpillar singular spectrum analysis (ICSSA), empirical mode decomposition (EMD), low pass filtering (LPF) and Whittaker smoother (Whit)) as well as methods working on limited temporal windows of a few weeks to few months (adaptive Savitzky–Golay filter (SGF), temporal smoothing and gap filling (TSGF), and asymmetric Gaussian function (AGF)), in addition to the simple climatological LAI yearly profile (Clim). Methods were applied to the MODIS leaf area index product for the period 2000–2008 and over 25 sites showed a large range of seasonal patterns. Performances were discussed with emphasis on the balance achieved by each method between accuracy and roughness depending on the fraction of missing observations and the length of the gaps. Results demonstrate that the EMD, LPF and AGF methods were failing because of a significant fraction of gaps (more than 20%), while ICSSA, Whit and SGF were always providing estimates for dates with missing data. TSGF (Clim) was able to fill more than 50% of the gaps for sites with more than 60% (80%) fraction of gaps. However, investigation of the accuracy of the reconstructed values shows that it degrades rapidly for sites with more than 20% missing data, particularly for ICSSA, Whit and SGF. In these conditions, TSGF provides the best performances that are significantly better than the simple Clim for gaps shorter than about 100 days. The roughness of the reconstructed temporal profiles shows large differences between the various methods, with a decrease of the roughness with the fraction of missing data, except for ICSSA. TSGF provides the smoothest temporal profiles for sites with a % gap > 30%. Conversely, ICSSA, LPF, Whit, AGF and Clim provide smoother profiles than TSGF for sites with a % gap < 30%. Impact of the accuracy and smoothness of the reconstructed time series were evaluated on the timing of phenological stages. The dates of start, maximum and end of the season are estimated with an accuracy of about 10 days for the sites with a % gap < 10% and increases rapidly with the % gap. TSGF provides more accurate estimates of phenological timing up to a % gap < 60%.","218795","Open Access","-0.2609","0.606","3","Lai à","Lai à","38",NA,NA,"",""

The results show that the three simulations have the best performance for forest sites and the poorest performance for cropland and grassland sites. In addition, the three simulations have difficulties capturing the seasonality of Mediterranean and sub-tropical biomes, characterized by dry summers. This reduced simulation performance is also reflected in deficiencies in diagnosed light-use efficiency (LUE) and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) dependencies compared to observations. Shortcomings in the forcing data may also play a role. These results indicate that more research is needed on the LUE and VPD functions for Mediterranean and sub-tropical biomes. Finally, this study highlights the importance of correctly representing phenology (i.e. leaf area evolution) and management (i.e. rotation-irrigation for cropland, and grazing-harvesting for grassland) to simulate the carbon dynamics of European ecosystems and the importance of ecosystem-level observations in model development and validation.","218795","Open Access","-0.1193","-0.5809","7","Aboveground biomass, Amazonian forest results, Biomass in amazonian","Aboveground biomass, Amazonian forest results, Biomass in amazonian","7",NA,NA,"",""

			      developed a set of satellite-based biogeophysical products, including
			      surface soil moisture (SSM) and leaf area index (LAI). This study
			      investigates the impact of joint assimilation of remotely sensed SSM
			      derived from Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) backscatter data and the
			      Copernicus Global Land GEOV1 satellite-based LAI product
			      into the the vegetation growth version of the Interactions
			      between Soil Biosphere Atmosphere (ISBA-A-gs) land surface model
			      within the the externalised surface model (SURFEX) modelling
			      platform of Météo-France. The ASCAT data were bias corrected with
			      respect to the model climatology by using a seasonal-based CDF
			      (Cumulative Distribution Function) matching technique. A multivariate
			      multi-scale land data assimilation system (LDAS) based on the extended
			      Kalman Filter (EKF) is used for monitoring the soil moisture,
			      terrestrial vegetation, surface carbon and energy fluxes across the
			      domain of France at a spatial resolution of 8 km. Each model grid
			      box is divided into a number of land covers, each having its own set of
			      prognostic variables. The filter algorithm is designed to provide
			      a distinct analysis for each land cover while using one observation
			      per grid box. The updated values are aggregated by computing
			      a weighted average.

			      In this study, it is demonstrated that the assimilation scheme works
			      effectively within the ISBA-A-gs model over a four-year period
			      (2008–2011). The EKF is able to extract useful information from the
			      data signal at the grid scale and distribute the root-zone soil
			      moisture and LAI increments throughout the mosaic structure of the
			      model. The impact of the assimilation on the vegetation phenology and
			      on the water and carbon fluxes varies from one season to another. The
			      spring drought of 2011 is an interesting case study of the
			      potential of the assimilation to improve drought
			      monitoring. A comparison between simulated and in situ soil moisture
			      gathered at the twelve SMOSMANIA (Soil Moisture Observing
			      System–Meteorological Automatic Network Integrated Application) stations shows improved anomaly
			      correlations for eight stations.","313085","Open Access","0.1221","-0.1617","8","Root water, Water uptake, Soil moisture","Root water, Water uptake, Soil moisture","15",NA,NA,"",""

The
			difficulty in mapping soil depth and in describing the capacity of plants to
			develop a rooting system is a major obstacle to the simulation of the
			terrestrial water cycle and to the representation of the impacts of drought.
			In this study, long time series of agricultural statistics are used to
			evaluate and constrain root water uptake models. The inter-annual variability
			of cereal grain yield and permanent grassland dry matter yield is simulated
			over France by the Interactions between Soil, Biosphere and Atmosphere,
			CO<sub>2</sub>-reactive (ISBA-A-gs) generic land surface model (LSM). The two soil
			profile schemes available in the model are used to simulate the above-ground
			biomass (<i>B</i><sub>ag</sub>) of cereals and grasslands: a two-layer
			force–restore (FR-2L) bulk reservoir model and a multi-layer diffusion (DIF)
			model. The DIF model is implemented with or without deep soil layers below
			the root zone. The evaluation of the various root water uptake models is
			achieved by using the French agricultural statistics of Agreste over the
			1994–2010 period at 45 cropland and 48 grassland départements, for a
			range of rooting depths. The number of départements where the simulated
			annual maximum <i>B</i><sub>ag</sub> presents a significant correlation with the
			yield observations is used as a metric to benchmark the root water uptake
			models. Significant correlations (<i>p</i> value < 0.01) are found for up to
			29 and 77% of the départements for cereals and grasslands,
			respectively. A rather neutral impact of the most refined versions of the
			model is found with respect to the simplified soil hydrology scheme. This
			shows that efforts should be made in future studies to reduce other sources
			of uncertainty, e.g. by using a more detailed soil and root density profile
			description together with satellite vegetation products. It is found that
			modelling additional subroot-zone base flow soil layers does not improve (and
			may even degrade) the representation of the inter-annual variability of the
			vegetation above-ground biomass. These results are particularly robust for
			grasslands, as calibrated simulations are able to represent the extreme 2003
			and 2007 years corresponding to unfavourable and favourable fodder
			production, respectively.","218795","Open Access","0.0332","-0.4486","8","Root water, Water uptake, Soil moisture","Root water, Water uptake, Soil moisture","4",NA,NA,"",""
