To guarantee that the data is being dealt in a secure manner we investigate the applicability of Assurance methodologies. In a typical Cloud environment the setup of multiple layers and different stakeholders determines security properties of individual components that are used to compose Cloud applications. We present a methodology adapted from Common Criteria for aggregating information reflecting the security properties of individual constituent components of Cloud applications. This aggregated information is used to categorise overall application security in terms of Assurance Levels and to provide a continuous assurance level evaluation. It gives the service owner an overview of the security of his service, without requiring detailed manual analyses of log files.","318580","Open Access","-0.2712","-0.423","3","Qa75","Qa75",NA,NA,NA,"",""

			Cloud Computing offers virtualized computing, storage, and networking resources, over the Internet, to organizations and individual users in a completely dynamic way. These cloud resources are cheaper, easier to manage, and more elastic than sets of local, physical, ones. This encourages customers to outsource their applications and services to the cloud. The migration of both data and applications outside the administrative domain of customers into a shared environment imposes transversal, functional problems across distinct platforms and technologies. This article provides a contemporary discussion of the most relevant functional problems associated with the current evolution of Cloud Computing, mainly from the network perspective. The paper also gives a concise description of Cloud Computing concepts and technologies. It starts with a brief history about cloud computing, tracing its roots. Then, architectural models of cloud services are described, and the most relevant products for Cloud Computing are briefly discussed along with a comprehensive literature review. The paper highlights and analyzes the most pertinent and practical network issues of relevance to the provision of high-assurance cloud services through the Internet, including security. Finally, trends and future research directions are also presented.","312758","Open Access","-0.4413","0.0099","2","Analysis of networking, Challenges in cloud, Cloud computing","Analysis of networking, Challenges in cloud, Cloud computing","1","151",11,"",""

Despite the benefits of such functionality, there are still several security issues which have not yet been thoroughly assessed and quantified. We investigate the impact of live virtual-machine migration on state-of-the-art anomaly detection (AD) techniques (namely PCA and K-means), by evaluating live migration under various attack types and intensities. We find that the performance for both detectors degrades as shown by their Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves when intra-cloud live migration is initiated while VMs are under a netscan (NS) or a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.","312758","Open Access","0.2979","0.5399","1","Qa75","Qa75",NA,NA,10,"",""

Many of these services are expected to be always on and have a critical nature; therefore, security and resilience are increasingly important aspects. In order to remain resilient, a cloud needs to possess the ability to react not only to known threats, but also to new challenges that target cloud infrastructures. In this paper we introduce and discuss an online cloud anomaly detection approach, comprising dedicated detection components of our cloud resilience architecture. More specifically, we exhibit the applicability of novelty detection under the one-class support Vector Machine (SVM) formulation at the hypervisor level, through the utilisation of features gathered at the system and network levels of a cloud node. We demonstrate that our scheme can reach a high detection accuracy of over 90% whilst detecting various types of malware and DoS attacks. Furthermore, we evaluate the merits of considering not only system-level data, but also network-level data depending on the attack type. Finally, the paper shows that our approach to detection using dedicated monitoring components per VM is particularly applicable to cloud scenarios and leads to a flexible detection system capable of detecting new malware strains with no prior knowledge of their functionality or their underlying instructions.\ud \ud Index Terms—Security, resilience, invasive software, multi-agent systems, network-level security and protection.","312758","Open Access","-0.2294","0.3356","5","Qa75","Qa75",NA,NA,24,"",""

Combining these properties is difficult, especially if the resulting solution is required to be efficient and incur low cost. We present AWE, the first erasure-coded distributed implementation of a multi-writer multi-reader read/write storage object that is, at the same time: (1) asynchronous, (2) wait-free, (3) atomic, (4) amnesic, (i.e., with data nodes storing a bounded number of values) and (5) Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) using the optimal number of nodes. Furthermore, AWE is efficient since it does not use public-key cryptography and requires data nodes that support only reads and writes, further reducing the cost of deployment and ownership of a distributed storage solution. Notably, AWE stores metadata separately from $k$-out-of-$n$ erasure-coded fragments. This enables AWE to be the first BFT protocol that uses as few as $2t+k$ data nodes to tolerate $t$ Byzantine nodes, for any $k \ge 1$.","317555","Open Access","0.587","-0.3469","4","And cluster computing, Computer science - distributed, Parallel","And cluster computing, Computer science - distributed, Parallel",NA,NA,5,"",""

We present Hybris key-value store, the first robust hybrid cloud storage system, aiming at addressing these concerns leveraging both private and public cloud resources. Hybris robustly replicates metadata on trusted private premises (private cloud), separately from data which is dispersed (using replication or erasure coding) across multiple untrusted public clouds. Hybris maintains metadata stored on private premises at the order of few dozens of bytes per key, avoiding the scalability bottleneck at the private cloud. In turn, the hybrid design allows Hybris to efficiently and robustly tolerate cloud outages, but also potential malice in clouds without overhead. Namely, to tolerate up to f malicious clouds, in the common case of the Hybris variant with data replication, writes replicate data across f + 1 clouds, whereas reads involve a single cloud. In the worst case, only up to f additional clouds are used. This is considerably better than earlier multi-cloud storage systems that required costly 3f + 1 clouds to mask f potentially malicious clouds. Finally, Hybris leverages strong metadata consistency to guarantee to Hybris applications strong data consistency without any modifications to the eventually consistent public clouds. We implemented Hybris in Java and evaluated it using a series of micro and macro-benchmarks. Our results show that Hybris significantly outperforms comparable multi-cloud storage systems and approaches the performance of bare-bone commodity public cloud storage.","317555","Open Access","0.057","-0.1155","2","Analysis of networking, Challenges in cloud, Cloud computing","Analysis of networking, Challenges in cloud, Cloud computing",NA,NA,0,"",""
