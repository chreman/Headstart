This can often lead to inadequate response to an emergency, which can in turn result in loss of property or even lives. Excessive response to an emergency can also result in a waste of highly resources. Our solution to address this problem is to make the citizen act as a camera for the control room by exploiting the user’s mobile camera. The system is designed to provide a live view of the citizen’s immediate surroundings, while control room personnel can provide instructions. In this paper, we introduce our approach and share initial insights from a focus group validation session and then four evaluations with users within a separate but closely related domain. We discuss our observations, evaluation results and provide a set of recommendations for the Emergency Response domain.","0.6334","0.0183","1","Camera, Control room, Response emergency","Camera, Control room, Response emergency",NA,NA,NA,"",""

The pulsars were found with a novel hierarchical search method originally developed for detecting continuous gravitational waves from rapidly rotating neutron stars. Designed to find isolated pulsars spinning at up to kHz frequencies, the new method is computationally efficient and incorporates several advances, including a metric-based gridding of the search parameter space (frequency, frequency derivative, and sky location) and the use of photon probability weights. The nine pulsars have spin frequencies between 3 and 12 Hz, and characteristic ages ranging from 17 kyr to 3 Myr. Two of them, PSRs J1803-2149 and J2111+ 4606, are young and energetic Galactic-plane pulsars (spin-down power above 6 × 1035 erg s-1 and ages below 100 kyr).

This has yielded unparalleled sensitivity to pulsars in compact binaries. The required computation time of approximately 17000 CPU core years was provided by the distributed volunteer computing project Einstein@Home, which has a sustained computing power of about 1 PFlop/s. We discovered 24 new pulsars in our search, of which 18 were isolated pulsars, and six were members of binary systems. Despite the wide filterbank channels and relatively slow sampling time of the PMPS data, we found pulsars with very large ratios of dispersion measure (DM) to spin period. Among those is PSR J1748-3009, the millisecond pulsar with the highest known DM (approximately 420 pc/cc). We also discovered PSR J1840-0643, which is in a binary system with an orbital period of 937 days, the fourth largest known. The new pulsar J1750-2536 likely belongs to the rare class of intermediate-mass binary pulsars. Three of the isolated pulsars show long-term nulling or intermittency in their emission, further increasing this growing family.

Recently, traditional sensors are complemented with low-cost social sensors. However, measurements derived by social sensors (i.e. crowdsourced observations) can be more spatially distributed but less accurate. In this study, we assess the usefulness for model performance of assimilating crowdsourced observations from a heterogeneous network of static physical, static social and dynamic social sensors. We assess potential effects on the model predictions to the extreme flood event occurred in the Bacchiglione catchment on May 2013. Flood predictions are estimated at the target point of Ponte degli Angeli (Vicenza), outlet of the Bacchiglione catchment, by means of a semi-distributed hydrological model. The contribution of the upstream sub-catchment is calculated using a conceptual hydrological model. The flow is propagated along the river reach using a hydraulic model. In both models, a Kalman filter is implemented to assimilate the real-time crowdsourced observations. We synthetically derived crowdsourced observations for either static social or dynamic social sensors because crowdsourced measures were not available. We consider three sets of experiments: (1) only physical sensors are available; (2) probability of receiving crowdsourced observations and (3) realistic scenario of citizen engagement based on population distribution. The results demonstrated the importance of integrating crowdsourced observations. Observations from upstream sub-catchments assimilated into the hydrological model ensures high model performance for high lead time values. Observations next to the outlet of the catchments provide good results for short lead times. Furthermore, citizen engagement level scenarios moved by a feeling of belonging to a community of friends indicated flood prediction improvements when such small communities are located upstream a particular target point.

In turn, this has stimulated the spread of low-cost sensors to allow citizens to participate in the collection of hydrological data in a more distributed way than the classic static physical sensors do. However, two main disadvantages of such crowdsourced data are the irregular availability and variable accuracy from sensor to sensor, which makes them challenging to use in hydrological modelling. This study aims to demonstrate that streamflow data, derived from crowdsourced water level observations, can improve flood prediction if integrated in hydrological models. Two different hydrological models, applied to four case studies, are considered. Realistic (albeit synthetic) time series are used to represent crowdsourced data in all case studies. In this study, it is found that the data accuracies have much more influence on the model results than the irregular frequencies of data availability at which the streamflow data are assimilated.
