This paper addresses the questions of single versus cross spectral performance and compares score-level fusion accuracy for different feature types, combining different wavelengths to overcome limitations in less constrained recording environments. Further it is investigated whether Doddington's “goats” (users who are particularly difficult to recognize) in one spectrum also extend to other spectra. Focusing on the question of feature stability at different wavelengths, this work uses manual ground truth segmentation, avoiding bias by segmentation impact. Experiments on the public UTIRIS multispectral iris dataset using 4 feature extraction techniques reveal a significant enhancement when combining NIR + Red for 2-channel and NIR + Red + Blue for 3-channel fusion, across different feature types. Selective feature-level fusion is investigated and shown to improve overall and especially cross-spectral performance without increasing the overall length of the iris code.","312583","Open Access","-0.3401","0.4746","3","Feature, Multispectral iris, Recognition","Feature, Multispectral iris, Recognition",NA,NA,NA,"",""

New unseen materials continuously challenge state-of-the-art spoofing detectors, suggesting for additional systematic approaches to target anti-spoofing. By incorporating liveness scores into the biometric fusion process, recognition accuracy can be enhanced, but traditional sum-rule based fusion algorithms are known to be highly sensitive to single spoofed instances. This paper investigates 1-median filtering as a spoofing-resistant generalised alternative to the sum-rule targeting the problem of partial multibiometric spoofing where m out of n biometric sources to be combined are attacked. Augmenting previous work, this paper investigates the dynamic detection and rejection of livenessrecognition pair outliers for spoofed samples in true multi-modal configuration with its inherent challenge of normalisation. As a further contribution, bootstrap aggregating (bagging) classifiers for fingerprint spoof-detection algorithm is presented.

Exploring various colour spaces, the proposed approach is robust to image noise and different gaze directions. The algorithm’s robustness is enhanced by a two-stage classifier. At the first stage, a set of simple classifiers is employed, while at the second stage, a neural network classifier operates on the probabilities’ space generated by the classifiers at stage 1.

The use of the toolkit is presented with a case study of LAIe estimation in discontinuous-canopy fruit plantations. The experiments are carried out in two study areas, namely, orange and almond plantations, with different percentages of canopy cover (48% and 40%, respectively). For comparison, two commonly used discrete-point LAIe estimation methods are also tested. The LiDAR LAIe values are first computed for each of the sites and each method as a whole, providing “apparent” site-level LAIe, which disregards the discontinuity of the plantations' canopies. Since the toolkit allows for the calculation of the study area LAIe at different spatial scales, between-tree-level clumping can be easily accounted for and is then used to illustrate the impact of the discontinuity of canopy cover on LAIe retrieval. The LiDAR LAIe estimates are therefore computed at smaller scales as a mean of LAIe in various grid-cell sizes, providing estimates of “actual” site-level LAIe. Subsequently, the LiDAR LAIe results are compared with theoretical models of “apparent” LAIe versus “actual” LAIe, based on known percent canopy cover in each site. The comparison of those models to LiDAR LAIe derived from the smallest grid-cell sizes against the estimates of LAIe for the whole site has shown that the LAIe estimates obtained from the CHP toolkit provided values that are closest to those of theoretical models.","FS100100040","Open Access","0.723","-0.0644","10","Canopy, Estimates, Laie","Canopy, Estimates, Laie",NA,NA,"0","",""
