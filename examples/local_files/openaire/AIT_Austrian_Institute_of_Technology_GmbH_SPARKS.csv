To meet these challenges, new types of control systems are connected over IT infrastructures. While this is done to meet highly set economical and environmental goals, it also introduces new sources of uncertainty in the control loops. In this thesis, we consider control design taking some of these uncertainties into account. In Part I of the thesis, some economical and environmental concerns in smart grids are taken into account, and a scheduling framework for static loads (e.g., smart appliances in residential areas) and dynamic loads (e.g., energy storage systems) in the distribution level is investigated. A robust formulation is proposed taking the user behavior uncertainty into account, so that the optimal scheduling cost is less sensitive to unpredictable changes in user preferences. In addition, a novel distributed algorithm for the studied scheduling framework is proposed, which aims at minimizing the aggregated electricity cost of a network of apartments sharing an energy storage system. We point out that the proposed scheduling framework is applicable to various uncertainty sources, storage technologies, and programmable electrical loads. In Part II of the thesis, we study smart grid uncertainty resulting from possible security threats. Smart grids are one of the most complex cyber-physical systems considered, and are vulnerable to various cyber and physical attacks. The attack scenarios consider cyber adversaries that may corrupt a few measurements and reference signals, which may degrade the system’s reliability and even destabilize the voltage magnitudes. In addition, a practical attack-resilient framework for networked control systems is proposed. This framework includes security information analytics to detect attacks and a resiliency policy to improve the performance of the system running under the attack. Stability and optimal performance of the networked control system under attack and by applying the proposed framework, is proved here. The framework has been applied to an energy management system and its efficiency is demonstrated on a critical attack scenario.

An attack space dened bythe adversary's model knowledge, disclosure, and disruption resources is introduced. Adversaries constrained by these resourcesare modeled for a networked control system architecture. It is shown that attack scenarios corresponding to denial-of-service,replay, zero-dynamics, and bias injection attacks on linear time-invariant systems can be analyzed using this framework.Furthermore, the attack policy for each scenario is described and the attack's impact is characterized using the concept ofsafe sets. An experimental setup based on a quadruple-tank process controlled over a wireless network is used to illustrate theattack scenarios, their consequences, and potential counter-measures.

It has been observed that a good '0'/'1'-balance of their responses correlates with longer settling times. This is problematic, since the state-of-the-art evaluation method requires the BR to be settled in order to generate a reliable PUF response. We show that settling times can easily extend beyond 100 ms for 70 percent of the responses in the TBR PUF, which is a BR-based PUF with good '0'/'1'-balance characteristics. Hence, it is practically impossible to wait for all BRs to settle, which results in a reliability penalty. In order to solve this problem, we present three new methods, which allow the evaluation of unsettled BRs with increased reliability compared to the state-of-the-art method. We were able to improve response reliability from 81 percent to up to 98.5 percent and achieve response reliabilities of 97 percent at an evaluation time of 320 ns. This enables the fast and reliable use of BR-based PUFs in strong PUF applications.","608224","Closed Access","-0.0774","0.7711","3","","",0,NA,NA,"",""

Malware such as Havex and BlackEnergy have been found targeting industrial control systems (ICS) and researchers have shown that cyber-attacks can exploit vulnerabilities in widely used Smart Grid communication standards. This paper addresses a deep investigation of attacks against the manufacturing message specification of IEC 61850, which is expected to become one of the most widely used communication services in Smart Grids. We investigate how an attacker can build a custom tool to execute man-in-the-middle attacks, manipulate data, and affect the physical system. Attack capabilities are demonstrated based on NESCOR scenarios to make it possible to thoroughly test these scenarios in a real system. The goal is to help understand the potential for such attacks, and to aid the development and testing of cyber security solutions. An attack use-case is presented that focuses on the standard for power utility automation, IEC 61850 in the context of inverter-based distributed energy resource devices; especially photovoltaic (PV) generators.","608224","Open Access","0.3163","-0.3908","7","","",9,NA,NA,"",""

With advances in connectivity, ICSs are now, typically, connected to communications networks and, as a result, can be accessed remotely. This extends the attack surface to include the potential for sophisticated cyber attacks, which can adversely impact ICS operation, resulting in service interruption, equipment damage, safety concerns, and associated financial implications. In this work, a novel cyber-physical security framework for ICSs is proposed, which incorporates an analytics tool for attack detection and executes a reliable estimation-based attack-resilient control policy, whenever an attack is detected. The proposed framework is adaptable to already implemented ICS and the stability and optimal performance of the controlled system under attack has been proved. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using a reduced order model of a real EMS site and simulated attacks.

As a consequence of this additional infrastructure, power networks are at an increased risk of cyber-attacks. In this letter, we address the problem of detecting and attributing anomalies that occur in the sub-meter power consumption measurements of a smart grid, which could be indicative of malicious behavior. We achieve this by clustering a set of statistical features of power measurements that are determined using the Smoothed Pseudo Wigner Ville (SPWV) energy Time-Frequency (TF) distribution. We show how this approach is able to more accurately distinguish clusters of energy consumption than simply using raw power measurements. Our ultimate goal is to apply the principles of profiling power consumption measurements as part of an enhanced anomaly detection system for smart grids.","608224","Open Access","0.5973","0.2381","2","Qa76","Qa76",11,NA,NA,"",""

Given their strict operating requirements, such systems are automated and controlled in real time by several digital controllers receiving measurements from sensors and transmitting control signals to actuators. Since these physical systems are often spatially distributed, there is a need for information technology (IT) infrastructures enabling the timely data flow between the system components. These networked control systems are ubiquitous in modern societies [1]. Examples include the electric power network, intelligent transport systems, and industrial processes.

We generalize a concept for a security index, which was previously introduced for static systems. The index exactly quantifies the resources necessary for targeted attacks to be undetectable and unidentifiable in the presence of disturbances. This information is useful for both risk assessment and for the design of anomaly detectors. Finally, we show how techniques from the fault detection literature can be used to decouple disturbances and to identify attacks, under certain sparsity constraints.
