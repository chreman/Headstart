To build-up the vision graph autonomously within a distributed smart-camera network, we use an ant-colony inspired mechanism, which exchanges responsibility for tracking objects using Vickrey auctions. Employing the learnt vision graph allows the system to optimise its communication continuously. Since distributed smart camera networks are prone to uncertainties in individual cameras, such as failures or changes in extrinsic parameters, the vision graph should be sufficiently robust and adaptable during runtime to enable seamless tracking and optimised communication. To better reflect real smart-camera platforms and networks, we consider that communication and handover are not instantaneous, and that cameras may be added, removed or their properties changed during runtime. Using our dynamic socio-economic approach, the network is able to continue tracking objects well, despite all these uncertainties, and in some cases even with improved performance. This demonstrates the adaptivity and robustness of our approach.","257906","Open Access","0.5164","-0.2676","1","Vision graph, Camera networks, Distributed smart camera","Vision graph, Camera networks, Distributed smart camera",NA,NA,NA,"",""

This report provides such guidelines on how to design self-aware and self-expressive computing systems in a principled way. We have documented different categories of self-awareness and self-expression level using architectural patterns. We have also documented common architectural primitives, their possible candidate techniques and attributes for architecting self-aware and self-expressive systems. Drawing on the knowledge obtained from the previous investigations, we proposed a pattern driven methodology for engineering self-aware and self-expressive systems to assist in utilising the patterns and primitives during design. The methodology contains detailed guidance to make decisions with respect to the possible design alternatives, providing a systematic way to build self-aware and self-expressive systems. Then, we qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated the methodology using two case studies. The results reveal that our pattern driven methodology covers the main aspects of engineering self-aware and self-expressive systems, and that the resulted systems perform significantly better than the non-self-aware systems.","257906","Open Access","0.101","0.5605","4","Computing systems, Expressive systems, Simulation environment","Computing systems, Expressive systems, Simulation environment",NA,NA,NA,"",""

It allows the participants to take turns playing solos made up of rhythmic pattern sequences. We specify the issue at hand for allowing such participation as being the requirement of decentralised coherent circulation of playing solos. This is to be realised by some form of intelligence within the devices used for participation. Here we take inspiration from the Economic Sciences, and propose this intelligence to take the form of making devices possessing the capability of evaluating their utility of playing the next solo, the capability of holding auctions, and of bidding within them. We show that holding auctions and bidding within them enables decentralisation of co-ordinating solo circulation, and a properly designed utility function enables coherence in the musical output. The approach helps achieve decentralised coherent circulation with artificial agents simulating human participants. The effectiveness of the approach is further supported when human users participate. As a result, the approach is shown to be effective at enabling participants with little or no musical training to play together in SoloJam.","257906","Open Access","-0.4963","-0.1631","11","Circulation, Playing, Solos","Circulation, Playing, Solos",NA,NA,NA,"",""

For instance, musical sound is often the result of body motion in the form of sound-producing actions, and muscial sound may lead to body motion such as dance. The research presented in this dissertation is focused on technologies and methods of studying lower-level features of motion, and how people relate motion to sound. Two experiments on so-called sound-tracing, meaning representation of perceptual sound features through body motion, have been carried out and analysed quantitatively. The motion of a number of participants has been recorded using stateof- the-art motion capture technologies. In order to determine the quality of the data that has been recorded, these technologies themselves are also a subject of research in this thesis.

			A toolbox for storing and streaming music-related data is presented. This toolbox allows synchronised recording of motion capture data from several systems, independently of systemspecific characteristics like data types or sampling rates.

			The thesis presents evaluations of four motion tracking systems used in research on musicrelated body motion. They include the Xsens motion capture suit, optical infrared marker-based systems from NaturalPoint and Qualisys, as well as the inertial sensors of an iPod Touch. These systems cover a range of motion tracking technologies, from state-of-the-art to low-cost and ubiquitous mobile devices. Weaknesses and strengths of the various systems are pointed out, with a focus on applications for music performance and analysis of music-related motion.

			The process of extracting features from motion data is discussed in the thesis, along with motion features used in analysis of sound-tracing experiments, including time-varying features and global features. Features for realtime use are also discussed related to the development of a new motion-based musical instrument: The SoundSaber.

			Finally, four papers on sound-tracing experiments present results and methods of analysing people’s bodily responses to short sound objects. These papers cover two experiments, presenting various analytical approaches. In the first experiment participants moved a rod in the air to mimic the sound qualities in the motion of the rod. In the second experiment the participants held two handles and a different selection of sound stimuli was used. In both experiments optical infrared marker-based motion capture technology was used to record the motion. The links between sound and motion were analysed using four approaches. (1) A pattern recognition classifier was trained to classify sound-tracings, and the performance of the classifier was analysed to search for similarity in motion patterns exhibited by participants. (2) Spearman’s p correlation was applied to analyse the correlation between individual sound and motion features. (3) Canonical correlation analysis was applied in order to analyse correlations between combinations of sound features and motion features in the sound-tracing experiments. (4) Traditional statistical tests were applied to compare sound-tracing strategies between a variety of sounds and participants differing in levels of musical training. Since the individual analysis methods provide different perspectives on the links between sound and motion, the use of several methods of analysis is recommended to obtain a broad understanding of how sound may evoke bodily responses.","257906","Open Access","-0.4892","0.3616","9","Motion, Sound","Motion, Sound",NA,NA,NA,"",""

Communication with the board is based on the ZigFlea protocol and it has been evaluated on a CUI32 using the StickOS oper- ating system. Experiments show that the total sensor data collection time is linearly increasing with the number of sensor samples used. A data rate of 0.8 kbit/s is achieved for wirelessly transmitting three axes of a 3D accelerometer. Although this data rate is low compared to other systems, our solution benefits from ease-of-use and stability, and is useful for applications that are not time-critical.

The hand motion of the participants was recorded, and has been analyzed using statistical tests, comparing results between different sounds, between different subjects, and between different sound classes. We have identified several relationships between sound and motion which are present in the majority of the subjects. A clear distinction was found in onset acceleration for motion to sounds with an impulsive dynamic envelope compared to non-impulsive sounds. Furthermore, vertical movement has been shown to be related to sound frequency, both in terms of spectral centroid and pitch. Moreover, a significantly higher amount of overall acceleration was observed for non-pitched sounds as compared to pitched sounds.

Designing such mechanisms has traditionally been carried out by hand, and more recently by automation. Assessing these mechanisms typically involves them being evaluated with respect to multiple conflicting objectives, which can often be nonlinear, noisy, and expensive to compute. For typical performance objectives, it is known that designed mechanisms often fall short on being optimal across all objectives simultaneously. However, in all previous automated approaches, either only a single objective is considered, or else the multiple performance objectives are combined into a single objective. In this paper we do not aggregate objectives, instead considering a direct, novel application of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to the problem of automated mechanism design. This allows the automatic discovery of trade-offs that such objectives impose on mechanisms. We pose the problem of mechanism design, specifically for the class of linear redistribution mechanisms, as a naturally existing multi-objective optimisation problem. We apply a modified version of NSGA-II in order to design mechanisms within this class, given economically relevant objectives such as welfare and fairness. This application of NSGA-II exposes tradeoffs between objectives, revealing relationships between them that were otherwise unknown for this mechanism class. The understanding of the trade-off gained from the application of MOEAs can thus help practitioners with an insightful application of discovered mechanisms in their respective real/artificial markets.","257906","Open Access","-0.0769","-0.5652","5","Multi objective","Multi objective","0",NA,NA,"",""

The developed algorithm equips each node with a local information about possible hubs which are present in its environment. Such information can be used by a node to change its connections whenever its fitness is not satisfying some given requirements. Eventually, we compare our algorithm with a randomized approach within an ecological scenario for the ICT domain, where a network of nodes carries a certain set of objects, and each node retrieves a subset at a certain time, constrained with limited resources in terms of energy and bandwidth.

While the field of multi-objective optimization has made many advances in applying scalarization techniques to obtain good solution trade-offs, the utility of applying these techniques in the multi-objective multi-agent learning domain has not yet been thoroughly investigated. Agents learn the value of their decisions by linearly scalarizing their reward signals at the local level, while acceptable system wide behaviour results. However, the non-linear relationship between weighting parameters of the scalarization function and the learned policy makes the discovery of system wide trade-offs time consuming. Our first contribution is a thorough analysis of well known scalarization schemes within the multi-objective multi-agent reinforcement learning setup. The analysed approaches intelligently explore the weight-space in order to find a wider range of system trade-offs. In our second contribution, we propose a novel adaptive weight algorithm which interacts with the underlying local multi-objective solvers and allows for a better coverage of the Pareto front.

This paper introduces a reference architecture as well as a novel modelling and simulation environment for self-aware and self-expressive systems with transaction level modelling, simulation and detailed modelling capabilities for hardware aspects, precise process chronology execution as well as fine timing resolutions. Furthermore, industrial relevant system sizes with several self-aware and self-expressive nodes can be handled by the modelling and simulation environment.","257906","Open Access","0.2104","0.6178","4","Computing systems, Expressive systems, Simulation environment","Computing systems, Expressive systems, Simulation environment","1",NA,NA,"",""

This gives rise to the vision of self-aware architecture, where design decisions and execution strategies for these concerns are dynamically analysed and seamlessly managed at run-time. Drawing on the concept of self-awareness from psychology, this paper extends the foundation of software architecture styles for self-adaptive systems to arrive at a new principled approach for architecting self-aware systems.

One of the main challenges in such research is to develop robust analysis techniques that are able to deal with the multidimensional data that musical sound and body motion present. The article evaluates four different analysis methods applied to an experiment in which participants moved their hands following perceptual features of short sound objects. Motion capture data has been analyzed and correlated with a set of quantitative sound features using four different methods: (a) a pattern recognition classifier, (b) t-tests, (c) Spearman s Á correlation, and (d) canonical correlation. This article shows how the analysis methods complement each other, and that applying several analysis techniques to the same data set can broaden the knowledge gained from the experiment.

A novel ant-colony inspired mechanism is used to learn the vision graph, that is, the camera neighbourhood relations, during runtime, which may then be used to optimise communication between cameras. The key benefits of our completely decentralised approach are on the one hand generating the vision graph online, enabling efficient deployment in unknown scenarios and camera network topologies, and on the other hand relying only on local information, increasing the robustness of the system. Since our market-based approach does not rely on a priori topology information, the need for any multicamera calibration can be avoided. We have evaluated our approach both in a simulation study and in network of real distributed smart cameras.","257906","Open Access","0.3074","-0.2789","1","Vision graph, Camera networks, Distributed smart camera","Vision graph, Camera networks, Distributed smart camera","29",NA,NA,"",""

We compare homogeneous configurations, when cameras use the same strategy, with heterogeneous configurations, when cameras use different strategies. Our first contribution is to establish that static heterogeneity leads to new outcomes that are more efficient than those possible with homogeneity. Next, two forms of dynamic heterogeneity are investigated: nonadaptive mixed strategies and adaptive strategies, which learn online. Our second contribution is to show that mixed strategies offer Pareto efficiency consistently comparable with the most efficient static heterogeneous configurations. Since the particular configuration required for high Pareto efficiency in a scenario will not be known in advance, our third contribution is to show how decentralized online learning can lead to more efficient outcomes than the homogeneous case. In some cases, outcomes from online learning were more efficient than all other evaluated configuration types. Our fourth contribution is to show that online learning typically leads to outcomes more evenly spread over the objective space. Our results provide insight into the relationship between static, dynamic, and adaptive heterogeneity, suggesting that all have a key role in achieving efficient self-organization.","257906","Open Access","0.48","-0.505","3","Smart camera networks, Distributed smart camera","Smart camera networks, Distributed smart camera","7",NA,NA,"",""

However, its flexibility is limited because it was initially designed to provide communication links between a few static nodes in a homogeneous network and did not attempt to solve the challenges of today’s dynamic network environments. Although the Internet has evolved to a global system of interconnected computer networks, which links together billions of heterogeneous compute nodes, its static architecture remained more or less the same. Nowadays the diversity in networked devices, communication requirements, and network conditions vary heavily, which makes it difficult for a static set of protocols to provide the required functionality. Therefore, we propose a self-aware network architecture in which protocol stacks can be built dynamically. Those protocol stacks can be optimized continuously during communication according to the current requirements. For this network architecture we propose an FPGA-based execution environment called EmbedNet that allows for a dynamic mapping of network protocols to either hardware or software. We show that our architecture can reduce the communication overhead significantly by adapting the protocol stack and that the dynamic hardware/software mapping of protocols considerably reduces the CPU load introduced by packet processing.","257906","Open Access","0.5056","0.0808","10","Applied mathematics, Awareness in computer, Cognitive inspired model","Applied mathematics, Awareness in computer, Cognitive inspired model","5",NA,NA,"",""

This kind of monitoring for self-adaptive systems can include collecting statistics about such systems themselves which can be computationally intensive (for detailed statistics) and hence time consuming, with possible negative impact on self-adaptive response time. To mitigate this limitation, we extend the technique of in-circuit runtime assertions to cover statistical assertions in hardware. The presented designs implement several statistical operators that can be exploited by self-adaptive systems; a novel optimization is developed for reducing the number of pairwise operators from ON to Olog⁡N. To illustrate the practicability and industrial relevance of our proposed approach, we evaluate our designs, chosen from a class of possible application scenarios, for their resource usage and the tradeoffs between hardware and software implementations.","257906","Open Access","-0.0033","0.2211","4","Computing systems, Expressive systems, Simulation environment","Computing systems, Expressive systems, Simulation environment","2",NA,NA,"",""

WSNs typically consist of hundreds or thousands of battery-operated tiny sensor nodes which are connected via a low data rate wireless network. A WSN application, such as object tracking or environmental monitoring, is composed of individual tasks which must be scheduled on each node. Naturally the order of task execution influences the performance of the WSN application. Scheduling the tasks such that the performance is increased while the energy consumption remains low is a key challenge. In this paper we apply online learning to task scheduling in order to explore the tradeoff between performance and energy consumption. This helps to dynamically identify effective scheduling policies for the sensor nodes. The energy consumption for computation and communication is represented by a parameter for each application task. We compare resource-aware task scheduling based on three online learning methods: independent reinforcement learning (RL), cooperative reinforcement learning (CRL), and exponential weight for exploration and exploitation (Exp3). Our evaluation is based on the performance and energy consumption of a prototypical target tracking application. We further determine the communication overhead and computational effort of these methods.","257906","Open Access","0.645","-0.0937","6","Resource aware","Resource aware","1",NA,NA,"",""

We find that in the scale-free networks the progression is faster than in random ones with the same average connectivity degree. For what concerns the role of perception, we find that the knowledge of the infection level in one's own neighborhood is the most effective property in stopping the spreading of a disease, but at the same time the more expensive one in terms of the quantity of required information, thus the cost/effectiveness optimum is a tradeoff between several parameters.","257756","Open Access","0.7156","0.1181","10","Applied mathematics, Awareness in computer, Cognitive inspired model","Applied mathematics, Awareness in computer, Cognitive inspired model","196","59",NA,"",""

As the recent improvements in computing power mostly come from the increasing number of nodes in a system and the integration of heterogeneous accelerators, how to scale the computing problems onto more nodes and various kinds of accelerators has become a challenge for the model development. This paper describes our efforts on developing a highly scalable framework for performing global atmospheric modeling on heterogeneous supercomputers equipped with various accelerators, such as GPU (Graphic Processing Unit), MIC (Many Integrated Core), and FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) cards. We propose a generalized partition scheme of the problem domain, so as to keep a balanced utilization of both CPU resources and accelerator resources. With optimizations on both computing and memory access patterns, we manage to achieve around 8 to 20 times speedup when comparing one hybrid GPU or MIC node with one CPU node with 12 cores. Using a customized FPGA-based data-flow engines, we see the potential to gain another 5 to 8 times improvement on performance. On heterogeneous supercomputers, such as Tianhe-1A and Tianhe-2, our framework is capable of achieving ideally linear scaling efficiency, and sustained double-precision performances of 581 Tflops on Tianhe-1A (using 3750 nodes) and 3.74 Pflops on Tianhe-2 (using 8644 nodes). Our study also provides an evaluation on the programming paradigm of various accelerator architectures (GPU, MIC, FPGA) for performing global atmospheric simulation, to form a picture about both the potential performance benefits and the programming efforts involved.","318521","Open Access","0.5478","0.3474","10","Applied mathematics, Awareness in computer, Cognitive inspired model","Applied mathematics, Awareness in computer, Cognitive inspired model","0","5","2","",""

The conclusion is that the motion observed in humans standing still is usually considerably higher than the noise level of the systems. Dependent on the system and its calibration, however, the signal-to-noise-ratio may in some cases be problematic.
