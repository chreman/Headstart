Educational design research assumes an ambitious position: a dual commitment to understand and contribute to both theory and practice. This task is confounded by the complexity of the domain and the inherent multi-stakeholder nature of most initiatives. Three barriers to success are identified: the shortage of mechanisms for cross-stakeholder dialogue, the failure to account for existing practices and contexts, and the rigid processes dictated by the dynamics of research projects. We report findings from an attempt to address these barriers. Confer is a Groupware tool that provides support to bridge face2face and online discussions by workgroups and has been co-designed with users by following the Participatory Patterns Design (PPD) methodology. The PPD provides a framework for engaging multidisciplinary communities in collaborative reflection on educational innovation in a given domain.","318209","Open Access","0.355","-0.527","4","Barriers, Design, Methodology","Barriers, Design, Methodology",NA,NA,NA,"",""

This approach uses the frequency and recency of previous tag assignments to estimate the probability of reusing a particular tag. Using three real-world folksonomies gathered from bookmarks in BibSonomy, CiteULike and Flickr, we show how adding a time-dependent component outperforms conventional \"most popular tags\" approaches and another existing and very effective but less theory-driven, time-dependent recommendation mechanism. By combining our approach with a simple resource-specific frequency analysis, our algorithm outperforms other well-established algorithms, such as FolkRank, Pairwise Interaction Tensor Factorization and Collaborative Filtering. We conclude that our approach provides an accurate and computationally efficient model of a user's temporal tagging behavior. We show how effective principles for information retrieval can be designed and implemented if human memory processes are taken into account.","318209","Open Access","-0.0521","0.6107","2","H.2.8","H.2.8",NA,NA,NA,"",""

Our algorithm follows a two-step approach, where in the first step a potentially interesting candidate item-set is found using user-based CF and in the second step this candidate item-set is ranked using item-based CF. Within this ranking step we integrate the information of tag usage and time using the Base-Level Learning (BLL) equation coming from human memory theory that is used to determine the reuse-probability of words and tags using a power-law forgetting function. As the results of our extensive evaluation conducted on data-sets gathered from three social tagging systems (BibSonomy, CiteULike and MovieLens) show, the usage of tag-based and time information via the BLL equation also helps to improve the ranking and recommendation process of items and thus, can be used to realize an effective item recommender that outperforms two alternative algorithms which also exploit time and tag-based information.","P 25593","Open Access","-0.2286","0.3883","2","H.2.8","H.2.8",NA,NA,NA,"",""

In line with distributed cognition theories, we look at both the tags students use and their strength of representation in memory. We hypothesize that categories get more differentiated over time as students learn, and that semantic stabilization on the group level (i.e. the convergence in the use of tags) mediates this relationship. Results of a field experiment that tested the impact of topic study duration on the specificity of tags confirms these hypotheses, although it was not study duration that produced this effect, but rather the effectiveness of the collaborative taxonomy the groups built. In the groups with higher levels of semantic stabilization, we found use of more specific tags and better representation in memory. We discuss these findings with regard to the important role of the information value of tags that would drive both the convergence on the group level as well as a shift to more specific levels of categorization. We also discuss the implication for cognitive science research by highlighting the importance of collaboratively built artefacts in the process of how knowledge is acquired, and implications for educational applications of collaborative tagging environments.","216356","Open Access","0.3048","0.4464","7","Human-computer interaction","Human-computer interaction",5,"5","45","",""

While the main conference takes place in a physical setting, attendees and virtual attendees socialize, introduce new ideas or broadcast information by microblogging on Twitter. In this paper we analyze the scholars' Twitter use in 16 Computer Science conferences over a timespan of five years. Our primary finding is that over the years there are increasing differences with respect to conversation use and information use in Twitter. We studied the interaction network between users to understand whether assumptions about the structure of the conversations hold over time and between different types of interactions, such as retweets, replies, and mentions. While `people come and people go', we want to understand what keeps people stay with the conference on Twitter. By casting the problem to a classification task, we find different factors that contribute to the continuing participation of users to the online Twitter conference activity. These results have implications for research communities to implement strategies for continuous and active participation among members.","318209","Open Access","0.1193","-0.1494","5","Computer science - social and information networks","Computer science - social and information networks",29,"102","92","",""
