However, little is known about their robustness against parameter perturbations and about their efficiency in preserving word similarities under memory constraints. In this paper, we investigate three post-processing methods for word embeddings to study their robustness and memory efficiency. We employ a dimensionality-based, a parameter-based and a resolution-based method to obtain parameter-reduced em-beddings and we provide a concept that connects the three approaches. We contrast these methods with the relative accuracy loss on six intrinsic evaluation tasks and compare them with regard to the memory efficiency of the reduced embeddings. The evaluation shows that low Bit-resolution embeddings offer great potential for memory savings by alleviating the risk of accuracy loss. The results indicate that post-processed word em-beddings could also enhance applications on resource limited devices with valuable word features.","10.1007/978-3-319-30671-1_15","0.2348","-0.5702","2","Evaluation","Evaluation","",""

Constructing a KNN graph rapidly and accurately is, however, a computationally intensive task. As data volumes keep growing, speed and the ability to scale out are becoming critical factors when deploying a KNN algorithm. In this work, we present KIFF, a generic, fast and scalable KNN graph construction algorithm. KIFF directly exploits the bipartite nature of most datasets to which KNN algorithms are applied. This simple but powerful strategy drastically limits the computational cost required to rapidly converge to an accurate KNN solution, especially for sparse datasets. Our evaluation on a representative range of datasets show that KIFF provides, on average, a speed-up factor of 14 against recent state-of-the art solutions while improving the quality of the KNN approximation by 18%.","","0.6001","-0.2438","4","[info.info-ai] computer science [cs]/artificial intelligence [cs.ai]","[info.info-ai] computer science [cs]/artificial intelligence [cs.ai]","",""

In this paper, we propose RACOON, a framework for the design of P2P systems that are resilient to selfish behaviours. While most existing solutions target specific systems or types of selfishness, RACOON proposes a generic and semi-automatic approach that achieves robust and reusable results. Also, RACOON supports the system designer in the performance-oriented tuning of the system, by proposing a novel approach that combines Game Theory and simulations. We illustrate the benefits of using RACOON by designing two P2P systems: a live streaming and an anonymous communication system. In simulations and a real deployment of the two applications on a testbed comprising 100 nodes, the systems designed using RACOON achieve both resilience to selfish nodes and high performance.","","-0.5833","0.3286","3","[info.info-ma] computer science [cs]/multiagent systems [cs.ma]","[info.info-ma] computer science [cs]/multiagent systems [cs.ma]","",""

To deal with this issue, several solutions have been proposed to query search engines in a privacy preserving way. A first category of solutions aim to hide users’ identities, thus enforcing unlinkability between a query and the identity of its originating user. A second category of approaches aims to obfuscate the content of users’ queries, or at generating fake queries in order to blur user profiles, thus enforcing indistinguishability between them. In this paper we propose PEAS, a new protocol for private Web search. PEAS combines a new efficient unlinkability protocol with a new accurate indistinguishability protocol. Experiments conducted using a real dataset of search logs show that compared to state-of-the-art approaches, PEAS decreases by up to 81.9% the number of queries linked to their original requesters. Furthermore, PEAS is accurate as it allows users to retrieve up to 95.3% of the results they would obtain using search engines in an unprotected way.","","0.3449","0.2735","1","Indistinguishability, Web search","Indistinguishability, Web search","",""

User information such as geographical location, academic and professional background, membership in groups, interests, preferences, opinions, etc. may be used in the process. Big data analysis techniques enable collecting accurate and rich information for user profiles in particular due to their ability to process unstructured as well as structured information in high volumes from multiple sources. Accurate and rich user profiles are important for personalization. For example, such data are required for recommender systems, which try to predict elements that a user has not yet considered. However, the information used for personalization can often be considered private, which raises privacy issues. In this paper, we discuss personalization with big data analysis techniques and the associated privacy challenges. We illustrate these aspects through the ongoing EEXCESS project. We provide a concrete example of a personalization service, proposed as part of the project, that relies on big data analysis techniques.","","-0.0261","0.6086","5","[info] computer science [cs]","[info] computer science [cs]","",""

However, using search engines raises serious privacy issues as the latter gather large amounts of data about individuals through their search queries. Two main techniques have been proposed to privately query search engines. A first category of approaches, called unlinkability, aims at disassociating the query and the identity of its requester. A second category of approaches, called indistinguishability, aims at hiding user's queries or user's interests by either obfuscating user's queries, or forging new fake queries. This paper presents a study of the level of protection offered by three popular solutions: Tor-based, TrackMeNot, and GooPIR. For this purpose, we present an efficient and scalable attack – SimAttack – leveraging a similarity metric to capture the distance between preliminary information about the users (i.e., history of query) and a new query. SimAttack de-anonymizes up to 36.7 % of queries protected by an unlinkability solution (i.e., Tor-based), and identifies up to 45.3 and 51.6 % of queries protected by indistinguishability solutions (i.e., TrackMeNot and GooPIR, respectively). In addition, SimAttack de-anonymizes 6.7 % more queries than state-of-the-art attacks and dramatically improves the performance of the attack on TrackMeNot by 23.6 %, while retaining an execution time faster by two orders of magnitude.","10.1186/s13174-016-0044-x","0.5006","0.3375","1","Indistinguishability, Web search","Indistinguishability, Web search","",""

The task of a recommender system for scientific publications is to provide a list of papers that match these criteria. Based on the collection of publications managed by Mendeley, four data sets have been assembled that reflect different aspects of relatedness. Each of these relatedness scenarios reflect a user's search strategy. These scenarios are public groups, venues, author publications and user libraries. The first three of these data sets are being made publicly available for other researchers to compare algorithms against. Three recommender systems have been implemented: a collaborative filtering system; a content-based filtering system; and a hybrid of these two systems. Results from testing demonstrate that collaborative filtering slightly outperforms the content-based approach, but fails in some scenarios. The hybrid system, that combines the two recommendation methods, provides the best performance, achieving a precision of up to 70%. This suggests that both techniques contribute complementary information in the context of recommending scientific literature and different approaches suite for different information needs.","","-0.2818","0.2124","6","H.3.7","H.3.7","",""
