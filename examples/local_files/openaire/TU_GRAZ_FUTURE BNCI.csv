Until recently, BCI research aimed almost solely at improving the life of disabled persons in need of communication and physical interaction with their environment. Impressive results have been obtained where disabled persons have learned how to control an artificial limb or a wheelchair using their thoughts. Nowadays, however, we also see research aimed at using BCI for the general population. This is an interesting development. Why would a non-disabled user want to use BCI? Or, how could a computer use BCI in order to better support its user? In this Special Issue, our emphasis is on brain–computer interfacing that aims at detecting and using the mental or affective state of the user in order to adapt the interface to the user.","248320","Open Access","0.1471","0.2192","6","Affective, Control, User","Affective, Control, User",NA,NA,NA,"",""

The last few years have seen a dramatic rise in journal publications, academic workshops and conferences, books, new products aimed at both healthy and disabled users, research funding from different sources, and media attention. This media attention has included both BCI fi (BCI-based science fiction) and stories in mainstream magazines and television news programs. Despite this progress and attention, most people still do not use BCIs, or even know what they are. While the authors of this book generally have access to the best BCI equipment, and they know how to use it, the chapters are written in the oldfashioned way, with keyboards and mice instead of BCIs. This may be surprising because BCIs are generally presented inaccurately in the popular media, where undeserved hype and sloppy reporting often create a gap between expectations and reality. This book aims to bridge that gap by educating readers about BCIs, with emphasis on making BCIs practical in real-world settings. Experts in BCI research widely agree that one of the major challenges in the field is moving BCIs from laboratory gadgets that work with some healthy users to tools that are reliable, straightforward, and useful in field settings for whoever needs them. Many of these experts discuss the state of the art and major challenges across four sections. Three of the sections address the three main components of BCIs: sensors, signals, and signal processing; devices and applications; and interfaces and environments. The last section summarizes other challenges that relate to complete BCI systems instead of one component.","248320","Open Access","-0.4083","-0.0396","3","Attention, Bcis, Challenges","Attention, Bcis, Challenges",NA,NA,NA,"",""

Second, we surveyed how well existing BCI companies are known to respondents. Third, we compared the ndings with our own preliminary overview of the marketability of BCIs and our repository of 28 companies. Respondents were optimistic about the marketability of BCIs for healthy users and users who need assistive technology, but 72.4 % of the respondents was unaware that companies already exist which market BCI's. Based on a preliminary market overview we cautiously suggest that optimism in relation to applications for healthy users is more appropriate than in relation to BCI-based assistive technology.

The European Commission (EC) has recently renewed their efforts to establish such a coordination effort by funding a coordination and support action for the BCI community called ‘BNCI Horizon 2020’ after the ‘Future BNCI’ project. Major goals of this new project include developing a roadmap for the next decade and beyond, encouraging discussion and collaboration within the BCI community, fostering communication with the general public, and the foundation of an international BCI Society. We present a short overview of current and past EU-funded BCI projects and provide evidence of a growing research and industrial community. Efficient communication also entails the establishment of clear terminology, which is a major goal of BNCI Horizon 2020. To this end, we give a brief overview of current BCI-related terms and definitions. A major networking activity in the project was the BNCI Horizon 2020 Retreat in Hallstatt, Austria. Over 60 experts participated in this event to discuss the future of the BCI field in a series of plenary talks, targeted discussions, and parallel focus sessions. A follow-up event was the EU BCI Day at the 6th International Brain-Computer Interface Conference in Graz, Austria. This networking event included plenary talks by eight companies and representatives from all seven ongoing EU research projects, poster presentations, demos, and discussions. Another goal of BNCI Horizon 2020 is the foundation of an official BCI Society. In this article, we summarize the current status of this process. Finally, we present visions for future BCI applications developed within BNCI Horizon 2020 using input from external BCI experts as well. We identify common themes and conclude with six exemplary use cases.","224051","Open Access","0.4522","-0.2116","9","Bnci horizon","Bnci horizon","14","142",42,"",""

Z.","2012-01-01","Institute of Physics","publication","","","","This paper summarizes two novel ways to extend brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. One way involves hybrid BCIs. A hybrid BCI is a system that combines a BCI with another device to help people send information. Different types of hybrid BCIs are discussed, along with challenges and issues. BCIs are also being extended through intelligent systems. Software that allows high-level control, incorporates context and the environment and/or uses virtual reality can substantially improve BCI systems. Throughout the paper, we critically address the real benefits of these improvements relative to existing technology and practices. We also present new challenges that are likely to emerge as these novel BCI directions become more widespread.","248320","Open Access","-0.461","-0.3302","1","Potentials","Potentials","2","109",47,"",""

At the same time, the development of BCI presents significant ethical and legal challenges. In a workshop during the 4th International BCI meeting (Asilomar, California, 2010), six panel members from various BCI laboratories and companies set out to identify and disentangle ethical issues related to BCI use in four case scenarios, which were inspired by current experiences in BCI laboratories. Results of the discussion are reported in this article, touching on topics such as the representation of persons with communication impairments, dealing with technological complexity and moral responsibility in multidisciplinary teams, and managing expectations, ranging from an individual user to the general public. Furthermore, we illustrate that where treatment and research interests conflict, ethical concerns arise. On the basis of the four case scenarios, we discuss salient, practical ethical issues that may confront any member of a typical multidisciplinary BCI team. We encourage the BCI and rehabilitation communities to engage in a dialogue, and to further identify and address pressing ethical issues as they occur in the practice of BCI research and its commercial applications.","248320","Closed Access","-0.0027","-0.3685","4","Bci research, Brain computer interface, Computer interface research","Bci research, Brain computer interface, Computer interface research","3","14",20,"",""
