Introduction to the special thematic session","Mohamad, Yehya","2016-01-01","","publication","","","","This STS on user experience and emotions for accessibility is targeted towards the elaboration on the topics of user experience and affective computing approaches and their relation to accessibility of electronic content. Accessible design as crucial condition for disabled users to get access to electronic content, which is also beneficial for non-disabled users, e.g. because of adaptability of information presentation accessing web services via smartphones. Accessibility so far pays less attention to user experience or emotional aspects of interaction, though they are important factors for disabled persons in similar way as for non-disabled persons. Additional to accessibility, considering user experience and emotional aspects of user interfaces would help disabled users for example to easily and efficiently use information systems and overcome communication disorders. Concepts for support of emotional interaction can on the other side increase the usability of electronic services for disabled users.","287774","Closed Access","-0.6438","-0.1633","1","Emotion, User experience","Emotion, User experience",NA,NA,NA,"",""

Ten users with CP participated in the study, in the experimental and control groups. Ten sessions of therapy provided improvements in head and trunk control that were higher in the experimental group for Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Goal Attainment Scaling
			(GAS) and Trunk Control Measurement Scale (TCMS). Significant differences (27% vs. 2% of percentage improvement) were found between the experimental and control groups for TCMS (p<0.05). The kinematic assessment shows that there are some improvements in active and passive range of motion, but no significant differences were found pre- and after-therapy. This new strategy, together with traditional rehabilitation therapies, could allow the child to reach maximum levels of function in the trunk and cervical regions.","287774","Open Access","0.3019","-0.2527","12","Cerebral palsy (cp)","Cerebral palsy (cp)","0",NA,NA,"",""

Head motion is recorded in a series of goal-crossing tasks and a regression model of the movement time (MT) is estimated for each user. Values of R2 above 0.9 are indicators of a strong correlation of those motion patterns with the linear model proposed by Fitts. The analysis of MT confirmed that head movements of users without disability follow Fitts’s law and showed that 3 users with CP (MACS IV and V) had the same behavior. There was a weaker correlation (R2=0.839) for one individual with cervical dystonia and ballistic movements and no correlation for two users with cervical hypotonia and dyskinetic CP. Results show the impact of ballistic movements and poor postural control in computer interaction. They also provide the foundation for new interaction techniques to develop a universal computer interface for motor impaired users.","287774","Embargo","0.0099","-0.3617","11","Fitts’s law","Fitts’s law","0","4","23","",""

The European Commission (EC) has recently renewed their efforts to establish such a coordination effort by funding a coordination and support action for the BCI community called ‘BNCI Horizon 2020’ after the ‘Future BNCI’ project. Major goals of this new project include developing a roadmap for the next decade and beyond, encouraging discussion and collaboration within the BCI community, fostering communication with the general public, and the foundation of an international BCI Society. We present a short overview of current and past EU-funded BCI projects and provide evidence of a growing research and industrial community. Efficient communication also entails the establishment of clear terminology, which is a major goal of BNCI Horizon 2020. To this end, we give a brief overview of current BCI-related terms and definitions. A major networking activity in the project was the BNCI Horizon 2020 Retreat in Hallstatt, Austria. Over 60 experts participated in this event to discuss the future of the BCI field in a series of plenary talks, targeted discussions, and parallel focus sessions. A follow-up event was the EU BCI Day at the 6th International Brain-Computer Interface Conference in Graz, Austria. This networking event included plenary talks by eight companies and representatives from all seven ongoing EU research projects, poster presentations, demos, and discussions. Another goal of BNCI Horizon 2020 is the foundation of an official BCI Society. In this article, we summarize the current status of this process. Finally, we present visions for future BCI applications developed within BNCI Horizon 2020 using input from external BCI experts as well. We identify common themes and conclude with six exemplary use cases.","224051","Open Access","-0.5468","0.4631","9","Bci, Bnci horizon, [info.info-bt] computer science [cs]/biotechnology","Bci, Bnci horizon, [info.info-bt] computer science [cs]/biotechnology","42","14","142","",""

Notwithstanding this progress, effective translation of these interfaces from proof-of concept prototypes into reliable applications remains elusive. As a matter of fact, most of the current BCI systems cannot be used independently for long periods of time by their intended end-users. Multiple factors that impair achieving this goal have already been identified. However, it is not clear how do they affect the overall BCI performance or how they should be tackled. This is worsened by the publication bias where only positive results are disseminated, preventing the research community from learning from its errors. This paper is the result of a workshop held at the 6th International BCI meeting in Asilomar.

The goal was to optimize the BCI individually in order to achieve high performance within few sessions for all users. Eight able-bodied volunteers, who were initially na?ve to the use of a BCI, participated in 10 sessions over a period of about 5 weeks. In an initial screening session, users were asked to perform the following seven mental tasks while multi-channel EEG was recorded: mental rotation, word association, auditory imagery, mental subtraction, spatial navigation, motor imagery of the left hand and motor imagery of both feet. Out of these seven mental tasks, the best 4-class combination as well as most reactive frequency band (between 8-30 Hz) was selected individually for online control. Classification was based on common spatial patterns and Fisher?s linear discriminant analysis. The number and time of classifier updates varied individually. Selection speed was increased by reducing trial length. To minimize differences in brain activity between sessions with and without feedback, sham feedback was provided in the screening and calibration runs in which usually no real-time feedback is shown. Selected task combinations and frequency ranges differed between users. The tasks that were included in the 4-class combination most often were (1) motor imagery of the left hand (2), one brain-teaser task (word association or mental subtraction) (3), mental rotation task and (4) one more dynamic imagery task (auditory imagery, spatial navigation, imagery of the feet). Participants achieved mean performances over sessions of 44-84% and peak performances in single-sessions of 58-93% in this user-centered 4-class BCI protocol. This protocol is highly adjustable to individual users and thus could increase the percentage of users who can gain and maintain BCI control. A high priority for future work is to examine this protocol with severely disabled users.","258169","Open Access","-0.3707","0.1371","14","Brain computer","Brain computer","35",NA,NA,"",""

Different mental activities modulate spontaneous EEG rhythms in various ways. Non-stationarity and inherent variability of EEG signals, however, make reliable recognition of modulated EEG patterns challenging. Able-bodied individuals who use a BCI for the first time achieve - on average - binary classification performance of about 75%. Performance in users with central nervous system (CNS) tissue damage is typically lower. User training generally enhances reliability of EEG pattern generation and thus also robustness of pattern recognition. In this study, we investigated the impact of mental tasks on binary classification performance in BCI users with central nervous system (CNS) tissue damage such as persons with stroke or spinal cord injury (SCI). Motor imagery (MI), that is the kinesthetic imagination of movement (e.g. squeezing a rubber ball with the right hand), is the \"gold standard\" and mainly used to modulate EEG patterns. Based on our recent results in able-bodied users, we hypothesized that pair- wise combination of \"brain-teaser\" (e.g. mental subtraction and mental word association) and \"dynamic imagery\" (e. g. hand and feet MI) tasks significantly increases classification performance of induced EEG patterns in the selected end-user group. Within- day (How stable is the classification within a day?) and between-day (How well does a model trained on day one perform on unseen data of day two?) analysis of variability of mental task pair classification in nine individuals confirmed the hypothesis. We found that the use of the classical MI task pair hand vs. feed leads to significantly lower classification accuracy - in average up to 15% less - in most users with stroke or SCI. User-specific selection of task pairs was again essential to enhance performance. We expect that the gained evidence will significantly contribute to make imagery-based BCI technology become accessible to a larger population of users including individuals with special needs due to CNS damage.","287774","Open Access","-0.1815","0.2582","14","Brain computer","Brain computer","16",NA,NA,"",""

Better understanding of the neural processing underlying motor control in affected individuals could lead to more targeted BCI rehabilitation and treatment options. We have explored well-known neural correlates of movement, including event-related desynchronization (ERD), phase synchrony, and a recently-introduced measure of phase dynamics, in participants with CP and healthy control participants. Although present, significantly less ERD and phase locking were found in the group with CP. Additionally, inter-group differences in phase dynamics were also significant. Taken together these findings suggest that users with CP exhibit lower levels of motor cortex activation during motor imagery, as reflected in lower levels of ongoing mu suppression and less functional connectivity. These differences indicate that development of BCIs for individuals with CP may pose additional challenges beyond those faced in providing BCIs to healthy individuals.","287774","Open Access","0.0581","0.0162","4","Brain-computer interface, Electroencephalogram (eeg)","Brain-computer interface, Electroencephalogram (eeg)","11","1","54","",""
