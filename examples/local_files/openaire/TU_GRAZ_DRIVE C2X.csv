We consider a Green Light Optimized Speed Advisory application implementation in a typical reference area and present the results of its performance analysis using an integrated cooperative intelligent transportation systems simulation platform. In addition, we study route alternation using vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to-vehicle communications. Our interest was to monitor the impacts of these applications on fuel and traffic efficiency by introducing metrics for average fuel consumption, average stop time behind a traffic light and average trip time, respectively. For gathering the results, we implemented two traffic scenarios defining routes through an urban area including traffic lights. The simulations are varied for different penetration rates of application-equipped vehicles, driver's compliance to the advised speed and traffic density.

Features in EDCA such as different contention windows (CW) and arbitration interframe space (AIFS) for each access category (AC) and internal collisions are taken into account. The analytical model is suitable for both basic access and the request-to-send/clear-to-send (RTS/CTS) access mode. Different from most of existing 3-D or 4-D Markov-chain-based analytical models for IEEE 802.11e EDCA, without computation complexity, the proposed analytical model is explicitly solvable and applies to four access categories of traffic in the IEEE 802.11p. The proposed model can be used for large-scale network analysis and validation of network simulators under saturated traffic conditions. Simulation results are given to demonstrate the accuracy of the analytical model. In addition, we investigate service differentiation capabilities of the IEEE 802.11p MAC sublayer. © 2011 IEEE.","270410","Open Access","0.5012","0.1184","2","Computersystemsorganization computer-communicationnetworks","Computersystemsorganization computer-communicationnetworks",NA,NA,92,"",""

The AMCMAC supports simultaneous transmissions on different service channels, as well as, allowing other nodes to make rendezvous with their provider/receiver or broadcast emergency messages on the control channel. We compare the performance of the proposed protocol with that of IEEE 1609.4 and Asynchronous Multichannel Coordination Protocol (AMCP), in terms of throughput on control and service channels, channel utilization, and the penetration rate of successfully broadcast emergency messages. We demonstrate that AMCMAC outperforms IEEE 1609.4 and AMCP in terms of system throughput by increasing the utilization of control channel and service channels. In addition, AMCMAC mitigates both the multi-channel hidden terminal and missing receiver problems which occur in asynchronous multichannel MAC protocols. © 2011 IEEE.","270410","Open Access","0.0518","0.5101","1","Computersystemsorganization computer-communicationnetworks","Computersystemsorganization computer-communicationnetworks",NA,NA,6,"",""

The proposed algorithm utilizes the prediction of the node's position and navigation information to improve the efficiency of routing protocol in a vehicular network. In addition, we use the information about link layer quality in terms of SNIR and MAC frame error rate to further improve the efficiency of the proposed routing protocol. This in particular helps to decrease end-to-end delay. Finally, carry-n-forward mechanism is employed as a repair strategy in sparse networks. It is shown that use of this technique increases packet delivery ratio, but increases end-to-end delay as well and is not recommended for QoS constraint services. Our results suggest that compared with GPSR, our proposal demonstrates better performance in the urban environment. © 2011 IEEE.","270410","Open Access","-0.1633","0.071","7","Computersystemsorganization computer-communicationnetworks","Computersystemsorganization computer-communicationnetworks",NA,NA,24,"",""
