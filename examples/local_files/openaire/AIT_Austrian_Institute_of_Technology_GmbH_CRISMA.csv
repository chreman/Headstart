Its objective is to develop a simulation-based decision support system, in different domains of the natural or industrial risk (flood, snowstorm, seism, forest fires, accidental pollution, urban accidents). The application in France, coordinated by ARTELIA Eau & Environnement, is devoted to the submersion risk on the Charente-Maritime coast and based on the experience feedback of the storm Xynthia in February, 2010. In this framework, a specific work is in progress through a thesis realized in collaboration between ARTELIA and lNRIA. Its objective is to elaborate a methodology of multi-model coupling which should be effective and applicable for the CRISMA project. These models may differ in several ways, related either to the physics and/or to the numeric concepts. The developed methodology may allow to taking into account more specific areas (urban zone, bridge in charge, …), but also should be able to simplify the simulation by dimension changes of model parts (for example, a 1D model for rivers, and a 2D one for sea). The present work addresses more specifically the problem of coupling models with different spatial dimensions.","284552","Open Access","-0.3904","-0.3924","3","Coupling","Coupling",NA,NA,NA,"",""

Modelling of river and marine flows is no exception to this rule. For many applications, engineers have now to implement complex \"modelling systems\", coupling several models and software, representing various parts of the physical system. Such modelling systems allow addressing numerous studies, like quantifying the impacts of industrial constructions or highway structures, or evaluating the consequences of an extreme event.In the framwork of the present thesis, we address model coupling techniques using Schwarz's methodology, which is based on domain decomposition methods. The basic principle is to reduce the resolution of a complex problem into several simpler sub-problems, thanks to an iterative algorithm. These methods are particularly well suited for industrial codes, since they are very few intrusive.This thesis was realized within the framework of a CIFRE contract and thanks to the funding of the European CRISMA project and was thus greatly influenced by this industrial context. It was performed within the Artelia company, in collaboration with the AIRSEA team of the Jean Kuntzmann Laboratory, with the main objective of transferring to Artelia some knowledge and expertise regarding coupling methodologies.In this thesis, we develop a methodology for multi-model coupling with heterogeneous dimensions, based on Schwarz's methods, in order to allow modelling of complex problems in operational cases. From the industrial viewpoint, the developed coupled models must use software meeting Artelia's needs (Telemac-3D, Mascaret, InterFOAM, Open-PALM).We firstly study a testcase coupling 1-D and 3-D free surface flows, using the same software system Telemac-Mascaret. The advantage of such coupling is a reduction of the computation cost, thanks to the use of a 1-D model. However the change in the model dimension makes it difficult to define properly the notion of coupling, leading to a coupled solution which is not defined in a unique way but depends on the choice of the interface operators.Then we study a coupling case between a monophasic model and a diphasic model (1-D/3-D and 3-D/3-D), using Telemac-Mascaret and InterFOAM software systems. Once again, the main difficulty lies in the definition of interfaces operators, due to the change in the physics (monophasic / diphasic). Such a coupling makes it possible to solve complex flows that the Telemac-Mascaret system alone cannot address (breaking waves, water blade, closed-conduit flow, etc.), by locally using InterFOAM where necessary (InterFOAM is very expensive in terms of computations). Finally, we implement such a monophasic/diphasic coupling on an operational engineering study.In addition, we also present the work done during the CRISMA project. The overall objective of the CRISMA project was to develop a simulation-based decision support system for the operational crisis management in different domains of natural or industrial risks (floods, forest fires, accidental pollution, etc.). In this context, Artelia coordinated the development of an application allowing to simulate various aspects of crisis linked to flood risks in Charente-Maritime.; Les progrès réalisés depuis plusieurs décennies, à la fois en termes de connaissances physiques, numériques et de puissance informatique disponible, permettent de traiter des simulations de plus en plus complexes. Les modélisations d'écoulements fluviaux et maritimes n'échappent pas à cette tendance. Ainsi, pour de très nombreuses applications de ce type, les modélisateurs doivent mettre en œuvre de véritables \"systèmes de modélisation\", couplant entre eux plusieurs modèles et logiciels, représentant différentes parties du système physique. La mise en place de tels systèmes permet de traiter de nombreuses études, comme par exemple les impacts de construction d'ouvrages d'art ou industriels, ou encore l'évaluation des aléas suite à un événement exceptionnel, etc. Dans le cadre de cette thèse, nous abordons cette problématique en utilisant une méthodologie de type Schwarz, empruntée à la théorie de décomposition de domaine, dont le principe est de ramener la résolution d'un problème complexe à celle de plusieurs sous-problèmes plus simples, grâce à un algorithme itératif. Ces méthodologies sont particulièrement bien adaptées au couplage de codes industriels puisqu'elles sont très peu intrusives. Cette thèse, réalisée dans le cadre d'un contrat CIFRE et grâce au financement du projet européen CRISMA, a été fortement ancrée dans un contexte industriel. Elle a été réalisée au sein d'Artelia en collaboration avec l'équipe AIRSEA du Laboratoire Jean Kuntzmann, avec pour objectif principal de transférer vers Artelia des connaissances et du savoir-faire concernant les méthodologies de couplage de modèles. Nous développons, dans le cadre de cette thèse, une méthodologie de couplage multi-modèles et de dimensions hétérogènes basée sur les méthodes de Schwarz, afin de permettre la modélisation de problématiques complexes dans des cas opérationnels (en complexifiant les problématiques étudiées au fur et à mesure de la thèse). Du point de vue industriel, les couplages mis en place sont fortement contraints par les logiciels utilisés répondant aux besoins d'Artelia (Telemac-3D, Mascaret, InterFOAM, Open-PALM). Nous étudions tout d'abord un couplage 1-D/3-D résolvant des écoulements à surface libre sous un même système de logiciel Telemac-Mascaret. L'avantage d'un tel couplage est une réduction de coût grâce à l'utilisation du modèle 1-D. Toutefois l’une des difficultés liées au changement de dimension réside dans la définition même de la notion de couplage entre des modèles de dimensions différentes. Ceci conduit à une solution couplée qui n’est pas définie d’une façon unique et qui dépend du choix des opérateurs d’interfaces. Puis nous nous intéressons au couplage monophasique/diphasique (1-D/3-D et 3-D/3-D) entre le système de logiciel Telemac-Mascaret et InterFOAM (modèle diphasique VOF), où la difficulté du choix des opérateurs d'interface lors du changement de physique (monophasique/diphasique) est aussi présente. Ce couplage a pour avantage de rendre possible la résolution d’écoulements complexes, que le système Telemac-Mascaret ne peut pas simuler (déferlement, lame d'eau, écoulement en charge, etc.) en utilisant localement InterFOAM avec son coût de calcul très important. Enfin, nous étudions l’application du couplage monophasique/diphasique sur un cas opérationnel d’étude d’ingénierie. Par ailleurs, les travaux effectués lors du projet CRISMA, pour le développement d'une application permettant de simuler les différents aspects d'une crise liée aux risques de submersions marines en Charente Maritime, coordonnés par Artelia, sont également présentés. Le projet CRISMA a pour objectif d'améliorer l'aide à la décision en se basant sur la simulation pour la gestion opérationnelle des situations de crise dans différents domaines du risque naturel et industriel (inondations, feux de forêt, pollutions accidentelles, etc.).","284552","Open Access","-0.4401","-0.0647","9","Domain decomposition method","Domain decomposition method",NA,NA,NA,"",""

We show that this problem can be tackled quite efficiently by designing a simple algorithm using techniques borrowed from domain decomposition theory. This algorithm is non intrusive, i.e. allows using existing numerical models with very few modifications. The method is illustrated on an academic test-case, namely a free surface flow in a bend-shaped channel. A 3-D Navier-Stokes model is coupled with a 1-D shallow water model, and results are compared to those obtained in a fully 3-D case. It is shown that the coupling algorithm provides an accurate solution, which can be improved thanks to an iterative algorithm (Schwarz method).

Due to rarity of such events, many crisis managers, regional planers and other stakeholders have no first-hand experience in handling them. The best available alternative is learning by doing in a simulated crisis situation or during an exercise. The EU FP7 project CRISMA (www.crismaproject.eu) - \"Modelling crisis management for improved action and preparedness\" has developed a methodology and software framework for simulation-based decision support systems. CRISMA targeted use cases in the preparatory phase of crisis management: short and long-term planning, desktop training and assessment in field trainings. Application prototypes cover different risk (floods, snowstorms, earthquakes, forest fires, accidental pollutions, mass accidents) and illustrate how the CRISMA framework can be used in a relatively simple but integrated manner to develop fully fledged decision support applications [Dihé et al., 2013]. This paper illustrates how each of these cases has been realized, explains how this work can be used to advance different aspects of crisis management preparedness and discusses if and why learning in virtual worlds can be more effective than from real world events.","284552","Closed Access","0.1201","-0.2926","4","Events, Learning, Crisis","Events, Learning, Crisis",NA,NA,NA,"",""

The project aims at the development of a framework to build use case specific tools which will allow decision-makers to cross-examine dynamic crisis scenario evolutions, to set action parameters of operational and strategic activities, and to visualise impacts and crisis evolvement. This will be achieved by providing a modular and open software framework to build planning and decision support systems for modelling and simulating realistic crisis scenarios and their possible consequences. CRISMA applications simulate and analyse the development of a simulated “World” in a crisis management context. A World is defined as a coherent set of data, simulation models operating on this data and the model control parameters governing the activity of these models. A snapshot of the World, or World State, consists of all data related to a specific crisis simulation experiment. This includes a set of information to control simulation models operating on the World data as well as a set of condensed, representative and quantitative information that can be used for a qualitative assessment of a world state. The user can influence a crisis evolvement by changing control parameters of the simulation models. Every modification of a World State is considered a distinct decision point and eventually produces a new World State. This leads to a decision tree.The architectural design approach uses several concepts from previous projects focusing on reference models, reference architectures and simulation-specific standards. For the CRISMA architecture, the project adopts certain common concepts that support a systematic architectural design process.In order to demonstrate and validate the design, five pilot sites are used to provide experimentation for validation and testing of a wide range of crisis management situations (coastal floods, extreme weather conditions, geophysical hazards, multi-organisational and cross-border cooperation in crisis management, planning and training for resource management). Piloting will include multi-risk and domino effects. The paper presents the business logic and key aspects of the CRISMA architecture. The work presented is work in progress, published during the design stage of the architecture. Implementation will be under way during the MODSIM 2013 conference.","284552","Closed Access","-0.0743","-0.3767","1","Architecture, Compare, Indicators","Architecture, Compare, Indicators",NA,NA,NA,"",""

The analysis indicates that a base rate of crashes depending on non-weather factors exists, and some combinations of extreme weather conditions are able to substantially push up crash rates on days with bad weather. Some spatial causation factors, such as variation of geophysical characteristics causing systematic differences in the distributions of weather variables, exist. Yet, even in winter, non-spatial factors are normally more significant. GIS data can support optimal deployment of rescue services and enhance in-depth quantitative analysis by helping to identify the most appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions.
