The task of a recommender system for scientific publications is to provide a list of papers that match these criteria. Based on the collection of publications managed by Mendeley, four data sets have been assembled that reflect different aspects of relatedness. Each of these relatedness scenarios reflect a user's search strategy. These scenarios are public groups, venues, author publications and user libraries. The first three of these data sets are being made publicly available for other researchers to compare algorithms against. Three recommender systems have been implemented: a collaborative filtering system; a content-based filtering system; and a hybrid of these two systems. Results from testing demonstrate that collaborative filtering slightly outperforms the content-based approach, but fails in some scenarios. The hybrid system, that combines the two recommendation methods, provides the best performance, achieving a precision of up to 70%. This suggests that both techniques contribute complementary information in the context of recommending scientific literature and different approaches suite for different information needs.","600601","Open Access","0.3532","0.4527","4","H.3.7","H.3.7",NA,NA,NA,"",""

First, we investigate the distribution of subject areas in user libraries of educational technology researchers on Mendeley. The results show that around 69% of the publications in an average user library can be attributed to a single subject area. Then, we use co-readership patterns to map the field of educational technology. The resulting visualization prototype, based on the most read publications in this field on Mendeley, reveals 13 topic areas of educational technology research. The visualization is a recent representation of the field: 80% of the publications included were published within ten years of data collection. The characteristics of the readers, however, introduce certain biases to the visualization. Knowledge domain visualizations based on readership statistics are therefore multifaceted and timely, but it is important that the characteristics of the underlying sample are made transparent.","251514","Open Access","0.6365","0.0502","2","Computer science - digital libraries","Computer science - digital libraries","12","157",3,"",""
