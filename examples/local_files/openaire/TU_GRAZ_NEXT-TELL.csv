The integrated model, is based on four existing models: TISL Heart Model [4], Design Inquiry Model [2], Scenario Design Process Model [5], and the Model for Integrating Design and Analytics in Scripting for CSCL (MIDAS4CSCL) [6]. The result is leading towards a new strand of inquiry, called teacher-led design inquiry of learning.","258114","Open Access","0.1946","0.0767","1","Teacher inquiry","Teacher inquiry",3,NA,NA,"",""
