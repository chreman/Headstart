While glacier retreat lays bare new settling ground, glacial discharge and ice-scouring are known factors modifying the structure of coastal benthic communities. However, effects on benthic biogeochemical processes like benthic carbon cycling remain largely unknown. To assess this question, diver-operated in situ measurements and sampling were performed at Potter Cove (King George Island, Antarctic Peninsula) at three sites, which differ in intensity of glacial discharge, frequency of ice-scouring and time since the Fourcade glacier retreated. Total and diffusive oxygen uptake (TOU and DOU), inorganic nitrogen fluxes and phosphate fluxes were determined and sediment characteristics and abundances of the dominant bivalve Laternula elliptica analysed. At the glacier front (recently glacier-free, high glacial discharge, high ice-scouring frequency) TOU, inorganic nitrogen and phosphate fluxes were lowest, while the highest fluxes were determined at the oldest glacier-free site (intermediate glacial discharge, intermediate ice-scouring frequency). In contrast, DOU revealed the opposite trend. At all sites TOU exceeded DOU at least five-fold, indicating that biogeochemical fluxes in Potter Cove were primarily mediated by macrofauna. This was partly supported by the trend of abundances of Laternula elliptica. Furthermore, sediment characteristics changed from silt-dominated at the glacier front to sand-dominated at the other sites. Our results reveal that high glacial discharge and high ice-scouring frequency influences benthic community structure, resulting in suppressed mineralization rates at glacier fronts. In contrast, intermediate disturbance seem to structure benthic communities in a way that causes higher mineralization rates compared to sites with low disturbances. In conclusion, ongoing warming will cause increasing remineralization rates in Antarctic coastal waters due to warming related increasing disturbance by glacial discharge and ice-scouring and their modifying effect on benthic community structures.","614141","Open Access","-0.3003","0.5675","2","Glacial discharge, Glacier, Ice scouring","Glacial discharge, Glacier, Ice scouring",NA,NA,NA,"",""

Specific attention was paid to allow in situ electrochemical detection of silicate in seawater. Thus, using a silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4) inorganic passivation layer patterned using Inductively Coupled Plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition (ICP-CVD), coupled with a non-aggressive lift-off based process, different electrodes were isolated electrically: one gold or platinum working electrode named \" macroelectrode \" (2 mm of diameter), four gold or platinum working ultramicroelectrodes (UME) (15 ␮m of diameter), one platinum counter electrode and one silver electrode which can be used as a reference electrode after its chlorination. Their small size and mass fabrication make them very promising for oceanographic applications. As some components of microdevices release silicate and contaminate the solution, after being immersed in seawater, these microdevices were inserted in a specific cell that only puts the electrodes in contact with the seawater solution. Gold has been tested as a possible material for working electrodes but its lack of adherence to the passivation layer in seawater solutions led to non-accurate measurements. On the contrary, passivation layer on platinum electrodes resists to the seawater corrosive medium. The analytical performances of the platinum microdevices has been tested through different silicate calibrations and shows an outstanding accuracy and reproducibility when measurements are performed, especially with the macroelectrodes which showed only 2.8% signal variation after four months of use and a limit of quantification of 0.50 ␮mol L −1 suitable for oceanographic applications.","614141","Open Access","-0.2708","-0.5964","3","[ spi.nano ] engineering sciences [physics]/micro and nanotechnologies/microelectronics","[ spi.nano ] engineering sciences [physics]/micro and nanotechnologies/microelectronics",3,NA,NA,"",""

That is demonstrated by fluorescence measurements involving several classes of fluorophores. Electrochemical measurements show that PET in several amino-modified dyes is thermodynamically favorable, even though it was not experimentally found, underlining the importance of kinetic aspects to the process. Consequently, the attachment of phenolic groups allows for fast and simple preparation of a wide selection of fluorescent pH-probes with tailor-made spectral properties, sensitive ranges, and individual advantages, so that a large number of applications can be realized. Fluorophores carrying phenolic groups may also be used for sensing analytes other than pH or molecular switching and signaling.","614141","Open Access","-0.6712","-0.0536","7","Article","Article",12,"1","21","",""

It combines a robust and long-term stable sensing material with a compact read-out device. The sensing material relies on a NIR pH indicator immobilized into ethyl cellulose along with a quaternary ammonium base. The perfluorinated polymer Hyflon AD 60 used as a protection layer significantly enhances the long-term and mechanical stability of the sensor foils, as well as the robustness against poisoning gases, e.g. hydrogen sulfide. The sensor can be stored under ambient conditions for more than six weeks, whereas sensors covered with silicone rubber deteriorate within one week under the same conditions. The complete sensor device is applicable after a three-point (re)calibration without a preconditioning step. The carbon dioxide production and consumption of the water plant Egeria densa was measured in the laboratory. Furthermore, results of profiling carbon dioxide measurements during a research cruise on the Baltic Sea at water depths up to 225 m are presented.","614141","Open Access","0.4351","-0.4506","6","Carbon dioxide, Sensor","Carbon dioxide, Sensor",1,NA,NA,"",""

In this study we have explored how experimental conditions affect measured rates of O2 consumption in low-O2 waters from the anoxic basin of Golfo Dulce (Costa Rica) and oceanic waters off Chile-Peru. High-sensitivity optode dots placed within all-glass incubation containers allowed for high resolution O2 concentration measurements in the nanomolar and low µmolar range and thus also for the determination of rates of oxygen consumption by microbial communities. Consumption rates increased dramatically (from 3 and up to 60 times) by prolonged incubations, and started to increase after 4-5 hours in surface waters and after 10-15 h in water from below the upper mixed layer. Estimated maximum growth rates during the incubations suggest the growth of opportunistic microorganism with doubling times as low as 2.8 and 4.6 h for the coastal waters of Golfo Dulce (Costa Rica) and oceanic waters off Chile and Peru, respectively. Deoxygenation by inert gas bubbling led to increases in subsequently determined rates, possibly by liberation of organics from lysis of sensitive organisms, particle or aggregate alterations or other processes mediated by the strong turbulence. Stirring of the water during the incubation led to an about 50% increase in samples previously deoxygenated by bubbling, but had no effect in untreated samples. Our data indicate that data for microbial activity obtained by short incubations of minimally manipulated water are most reliable, but deoxygenation is a prerequisite for many laboratory experiments, such as determination of denitrification rates, as O2 contamination by sampling is practically impossible to avoid.","614141","Open Access","0.2715","0.4891","5","Bottle effects","Bottle effects",1,"5","9","",""

Here, we describe the optimization of the molybdenum blue method for in situ work using a lab-on-chip (LOC) analyzer and evaluate its performance in the laboratory and at two contrasting field sites. The in situ performance of the LOC sensor is evaluated using hourly time-series data from a 56-day trial in Southampton Water (UK), as well as a month-long deployment in the subtropical oligotrophic waters of Kaneohe Bay (Hawaii, USA). In Kaneohe Bay, where phosphate concentrations were characteristic of the dry season (0.13 ± 0.03 μM, n = 704), the in situ sensor accuracy was 16 ± 12% and a potential diurnal cycle in phosphate concentrations was observed. In Southampton Water, the sensor data (1.02 ± 0.40 μM, n = 1,267) were accurate to ±0.10 μM relative to discrete reference samples. Hourly in situ monitoring revealed striking tidal and storm derived fluctuations in phosphate concentrations in Southampton Water that would not have been captured via discrete sampling. We show the impact of storms on phosphate concentrations in Southampton Water is modulated by the spring-neap tidal cycle and that the 10-fold decline in phosphate concentrations observed during the later stages of the deployment was consistent with the timing of a spring phytoplankton bloom in the English Channel. Under controlled laboratory conditions in a 250 L tank, the sensor demonstrated an accuracy and precision better than 10% irrespective of the salinity (0–30), turbidity (0–100 NTU), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) concentration (0–10 mg/L), and temperature (5–20°C) of the water (0.3–13 μM phosphate) being analyzed. This work demonstrates that the LOC technology is mature enough to quantify the influence of stochastic events on nutrient budgets and to elucidate the role of phosphate in regulating phytoplankton productivity and community composition in estuarine and coastal regimes.","614141","Open Access","0.5075","0.0921","1","Nutrient sensor challenge","Nutrient sensor challenge",4,"22","10","",""

Iron is a redox sensitive element, with Fe(II) and Fe(III) co-existing in natural waters. Whilst Fe(II) is the most soluble form, it is also transient with rapid oxidation rates in oxic seawater. Measurements of Fe(II) are therefore preferably undertaken in situ. For this purpose an autonomous wet chemical analyzer based on lab-on-chip technology was developed for the in situ determination of the concentration of dissolved (&lt;0.45 μm) Fe species (Fe(II) and labile Fe) suitable for deployments in a wide range of aquatic environments. The spectrophotometric approach utilizes a buffered ferrozine solution and a ferrozine/ascorbic acid mixture for Fe(II) and labile Fe(III) analyses, respectively. Diffusive mixing, color development and spectrophotometric detection take place in three separate flow cells with different lengths such that the analyzer can measure a broad concentration range from low nM to several μM of Fe, depending on the desired application. A detection limit of 1.9 nM Fe was found. The microfluidic analyzer was tested in situ for nine days in shallow waters in the Kiel Fjord (Germany) along with other sensors as a part of the SenseOCEAN EU-project. The analyzer's performance under natural conditions was assessed with discrete samples collected and processed according to GEOTRACES protocol [acidified to pH &lt; 2 and analyzed via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)]. The mechanical performance of the analyzer over the nine day period was good (consistent high precision of Fe(II) and Fe(III) standards with a standard deviation of 2.7% (n = 214) and 1.9% (n = 217), respectively, and successful completion of every programmed data point). However, total dissolved Fe was consistently low compared to ICP-MS data. Recoveries between 16 and 75% were observed, indicating that the analyzer does not measure a significant fraction of natural dissolved Fe species in coastal seawater. It is suggested that an acidification step would be necessary in order to ensure that the analyzer derived total dissolved Fe concentration is reproducible and consistent with discrete values.","614141","Open Access","0.0282","-0.0481","4","Analyzer, Dissolved, Fe ii","Analyzer, Dissolved, Fe ii",0,"11","10","",""
