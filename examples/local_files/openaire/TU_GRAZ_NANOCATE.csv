Key parameters are the electrical conductivity σ and the Seebeck-coefficient α which are combined in the Power-Factor (PF = α²·σ) to express the efficiency of a thermoelectric material. It is desired to manufacture bendable or flexible thermoelectric generators (TEGs) by low-cost and large scale production techniques e.g. printing. Therefore, composites made of intrinsically conducting polymer and nanoparticles, especially carbon nanotubes, which are printable, are the focus of this work. The intrinsically conducting polymer, PEDOT:PSS doped with DMSO, was used in combination with different types of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT). The SWCNTs were mixed with various dispersants and then added to the PEDOT:PSS disperison. The composite dispersions with different amounts of SWCNTs were deposited by Spin-Coating and characterized. The results showed an increase of the Power-Factor by ~30% compared to pristine PEDOT:PSS. Furthermore the influence of the dispersants and the dispersing methods on PEDOT:PSS and SWCNTs were investigated.","604647","Open Access","-0.2032","-0.064","6","Cnt","Cnt",NA,NA,NA,"",""

The process generates 2D and 3D structures or multilayers with a high material utilization. For high viscosity pastes dispenser printing was applied; for low viscosity materials and fine patterns aerosoljet printing is suited. Mainly polymers are used as active printed material. Besides, a wide variety of metal based contact materials is available including silver, copper or nickel. As application example the printing of polymer based thermoelectric modules for the cost-efficient recycling of waste heat in the temperature range from room temperature up to 100 °C was demonstrated. Several designs are evaluated. Beneath two vertical designs also the printing of p-type and n-type thermoelectric material into non-woven substrates is studied, enabling the manufacturing of flexible thermoelectric modules in a continuous, automated process.","604647","Closed Access","-0.2161","0.5175","3","","",NA,NA,NA,"",""

These characteristics and their low thermal conductivity make them suitable for thermoelectric generation. In this study a PEDOT:tos-Silver thermoelectric module (TEM) has been printed and tested. A computational model able to simulate the behavior of polymer thermoelectric generators (TEGs) has been developed and validated with the experimental data. The validated computational model has been used to geometrically optimize the power generation of the polymer TEM. The π-sectional area of the p-type and n-type legs, their length and the number of thermocouples have been modified obtaining an improvement of 50 times the power generated by the printed module, the base design. The optimized geometry has been studied into a real application scenario of waste heat harvesting, a tile furnace with a smoke mass flow of 6.39 kg/s and a temperature of 187°C. The thermoelectric generation of the polymer TEG located at the exhaust of the tile furnace ascends to 21.73 MW h/year. In comparison with the bismuth-telluride commercial modules, the polymer production is six times lower, however, the advantages of the polymers materials over the commercial modules make them suitable for thermoelectric generation.","604647","Closed Access","0.1158","0.4843","1","Computational model, Design for flexible, Flexible polymer thermoelectric","Computational model, Design for flexible, Flexible polymer thermoelectric",9,NA,NA,"",""

Later, we intentionally modified the electrical conductivity by functionalization with iodine and investigated the changes in the band structure by optical absorption spectroscopy. Measuring in parallel the tubes electrical conductivity and optical absorption spectra, we found that conduction mechanism in SWCNT is comparable to that of intrinsically conducting polymers. We identified, in analogy to conducting polymers, in the infrared spectra a new absorption band which is responsible for the increased conductivity, leading to a closing gap in semiconducting SWCNT. We could show that by different functionalizations of the same SWCNT starting material the properties like conductivity can be dramatically changed, leading to different imaginable applications.

We observed a decrease of the transition energies in both metallic and semiconducting SWCNT with increasing temperature determined by the shift of the S11-, S22- and M11-absorption bands. The shifts follow the Varshni-equation. Furthermore, calculation of the average exciton binding energy (80–90 meV) in metallic SWCNT from the shift of the M11-band was performed.

Its potential applications cover many fields, e.g. thermoelectric energy conversion. Therefore we compared the thermoelectric properties of pristine and DMSO treated PEDOT:PSS films at potential operating temperatures. Here we observed the electrical degradation of the film up to complete failure. Further, the thermal aging of PEDOT:PSS still lacks of understanding. It is pointed out that PEDOT:PSS films show a complex degradation mechanism which includes a morphological and a chemical part. In the range of room temperature and ∼160 °C PEDOT:PSS films follow the known exponential degradation which imposes morphological degradation, while at higher temperatures this law is not suitable to match the experimental data. Thus we extended the known exponential equation by an additional exponential degradation term which shows good agreement with the experimental data. The optical absorption spectrum indicates a loss in bipolaron and polaron charge carriers, which reflects the degradation behavior. It can be seen that changes in the optical absorption spectrum after isothermal annealing for more than 50 h occur at temperatures around 120 °C, which marks the transition from morphological to chemical degradation.","604647","Closed Access","-0.4975","-0.2656","8","Aging","Aging",2,"3","15","",""

The effects of SPS conditions on the anisotropic thermoelectric properties and microstructure evolutions were systematically investigated. The change of sintering temperature showed stronger influence than other sintering parameters to the resulting thermoelectric properties. Samples sintered over the temperature range between 653 K and 773 K showed significant differences in the degrees of orientations. The change was mainly caused by grain growth and re-orientation. Despite of the anisotropy, zT value as high as 1.2 to 1.3 was achieved over the temperature range of 300 to 360 K by directly using commercial power sintered at 723 and 773 K. The sintering profiles and microstructure evolutions during SPS were illustrated and the thermoelectric properties as a function of the degrees of orientations were shown and discussed in detail.","604647","Open Access","0.5002","-0.2095","5","Grain growth","Grain growth",7,NA,NA,"",""

It is concluded that addition of base derives a dedoping of the PEDOT chain and increase Seebeck coefficient from 15 µV/K to 90 µV/K. Supportive UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy was used for tracking the doping level of the polymer. A surface morphology study of the dedoped PEDOT:PSS films was monitored by SEM. It was shown that if KOH is used in excess with respect to the acid component of PEDOT:PSS dispersions, it segregates at the surface forming crystallites. They, however could be easily removed by methanol rinsing without destroying the sample integrity. After material modification, a dispenser-printed polymer unileg-TEG with 61 unicouples was fabricated by printing. The TEG in form of 253 mm-long stripe shows a flexible behavior. At 90 K temperature difference a resulting power output of ~ 100 nW could be measured. We suggest that the low power output is due to a high internal generator resistance.","604647","Closed Access","-0.4898","0.213","9","Flexible","Flexible",3,NA,NA,"",""

Special emphasis is given to n-type polymers, since this group of polymers is often neglected due to unavailability or poor stability during processing.
