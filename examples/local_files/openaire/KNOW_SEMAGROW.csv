VocBench has a strong focus on collaboration, supported by workflow management for content validation and publication. Dedicated user roles provide a clean separation of competences, addressing different specificities ranging from management as-pects to vertical competences on content editing, such as conceptualization versus terminology editing. Extensive support for scheme management allows editors to fully exploit the possibilities of the SKOS model, as well as to fulfill its integrity constraints. We discuss thoroughly the main features of VocBench, detail its ar-chitecture, and evaluate it under both a functional and user-appreciation ground, through a comparison with state-of-the-art and user questionnaires analysis, re-spectively. Finally, we provide insights on future developments.","318497","Open Access","-0.609","0.1288","2","Ln. data base management systems.","Ln. data base management systems.",11,NA,NA,"",""

Histograms can be constructed by scanning the database tables and aggregating the values of the attributes in the table, or, more efficiently, progressively refined by analysing query results. Most of the relevant literature focuses on histograms of numerical data, exploiting the natural concept of a numerical range as an estimator of the volume of data that falls within the range. This, however, leaves Semantic Web data outside the scope of the histograms literature, as its most prominent datatype, the URI, does not offer itself to defining such ranges. This article first establishes a framework that formalises histograms over arbitrary data types and provides a formalism for specifying value ranges for different datatypes. This makes explicit the properties that ranges are required to have, so that histogram refinement algorithms are applicable. We demonstrate that our framework subsumes histograms over numerical data as a special case by using to formulate the state-of-the-art in numerical histograms. We then proceed to use the Jaro-Winkler metric to define URI ranges by exploiting the hierarchical nature of URI strings. This greatly extends the state of the art, where strings are treated as categorical data that can only be described by enumeration. We then present the open-source STRHist system that implements these ideas. We finally present empirical evaluation results using STRHist over a real dataset and query workload extracted from AGRIS, the most popular and widely used bibliographic database on agricultural research and technology.","318497","Open Access","0.2398","0.5716","6","Database management","Database management",0,NA,NA,"",""

In recent years, the incorporation of multiple relevance criteria has attracted increased interest. Such multi-criteria recommendation approaches are researched as a paradigm for building intelligent systems that can be tailored to multiple interest indicators of end-users – such as combinations of implicit and explicit interest indicators in the form of ratings or ratings on multiple relevance dimensions. Nevertheless, evaluation of these recommendation techniques in the context of real-life applications still remains rather limited. Previous studies dealing with the evaluation of recommender systems have outlined that the performance of such algorithms is often dependent on the dataset – and indicate the importance of carrying out careful testing and parameterization. Especially when looking at large scale datasets, it becomes very difficult to deploy evaluation methods that may help in assessing the effect that different system components have to the overall design. In this paper, we study how layered evaluation can be applied for the case of a multi-criteria recommendation service that we plan to deploy for paper recommendation using the Mendeley dataset. The paper introduces layered evaluation and suggests two experiments that may help assess the components of the envisaged system separately.","318497","Open Access","0.5007","-0.3897","10","Recommender systems","Recommender systems",5,NA,NA,"",""

Scientists now publish their research interests, theories and outcomes across numerous channels, including personal blogs and other thematic web spaces where ideas, activities and partial results are discussed. Accordingly, information systems that facilitate access to scientific literature must learn to cope with this valuable and varied data, evolving to make this research easily discoverable and available to end users. In this paper we describe the incremental process of discovering web resources in the domain of agricultural science and technology. Making use of Linked Open Data methodologies, we interlink a wide array of custom-crawled resources with the AGRIS bibliographic database in order to enrich the user experience of the AGRIS website. We also discuss the SemaGrow Stack, a query federation and data integration infrastructure used to estimate the semantic distance between crawled web resources and AGRIS.","318497","Open Access","0.0896","0.0466","14","Web and social media","Web and social media",1,"1","3","",""
