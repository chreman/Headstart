However, from the modeling point of view liquid-feed DMFC are challenging systems due to the complex electrochemistry, the inherent two-phase transport and the effect of methanol crossover. In this paper we present a physical 1D cell model to describe the relevant processes for DMFC performance ranging from electrochemistry on the surface of the catalyst up to transport on the cell level. A two-phase flow model is implemented describing the transport in gas diffusion layer and catalyst layer at the anode side. Electrochemistry is described by elementary steps for the reactions occurring at anode and cathode, including adsorbed intermediate species on the platinum and ruthenium surfaces. Furthermore, a detailed membrane model including methanol crossover is employed. The model is validated using polarization curves, methanol crossover measurements and impedance spectra. It permits to analyze both steady-state and transient behavior with a high level of predictive capabilities. Steady-state simulations are used to investigate the open circuit voltage as well as the overpotentials of anode, cathode and electrolyte. Finally, the transient behavior after current interruption is studied in detail","621216","Embargo","-0.031","-0.4667","4","Computergestützte elektrochemie","Computergestützte elektrochemie",2,NA,NA,"",""

			                among Moroccan children remains significant. However, scarce
			                information is available regarding trends in its epidemiology
			                and etiology, or regarding its associated prognostic factors.
			                The purpose of this work was to review available data on the
			                burden of ARI among children under five years of age in Morocco.
			                METHODS: A systematic review was conducted for the period
			                1997-2014 using the PRISMA proposed methodology. Various online
			                databases were screened, in addition to physical libraries of
			                Moroccan medical schools, and official reports of the Moroccan
			                Ministry of Health. Search queries in English and French
			                languages included: Respiratory Tract Infections, pneumonia,
			                epidemiology, etiology, microbiology, mortality and Morocco. The
			                documents were included for analysis when they reported original
			                data on the incidence, distribution, or a clinical description
			                of the diseases or their etiology or described clinical
			                management or national preventive strategies. RESULTS:
			                Thirty-two documents were included in the final analysis. 21 of
			                which had been published. In 2012, ARI caused 13% of paediatric
			                deaths, half of the consultations at health facilities and third
			                of the paediatric admissions. The microorganisms more frequently
			                identified among hospitalized children were Streptococcus
			                pneumoniae (38%) and Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) (15%).
			                The MOH introduced Hib vaccines into the national immunization
			                program (PNI) in 2007and the 13-valent vaccine against
			                pneumococcus in 2010. The national first line antibiotics
			                recommended for non-severe ambulatory treatment is Amoxicillin.
			                Studies of antibiotic resistance showed from 1998 to 2008 a 22%
			                increase in the rate of penicillin non-susceptibility among
			                Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. Viral respiratory infections
			                and the role attributed to air pollution in the incidence of ARI
			                have been poorly characterized. CONCLUSIONS: Further efforts
			                should be made towards the development of adequate surveillance
			                programs to better clarify the epidemiology, etiology,
			                antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and the effectiveness of
			                the preventives and curatives strategies in place against
			                paediatric ARIs in Morocco. Additionally, a holistical approach
			                should be used to identify the heath determinants of ARIs among
			                children.","621216","Open Access","0.678","-0.2729","3","Epidemiology","Epidemiology",2,"3","25","",""

Therefore, obtaining a deeper knowledge is fundamental in order to establish fuel cells as competitive product. A segmented single cell was operated under open circuit voltage with alternating relative humidity. The influence of the catalyst layer on membrane degradation was evaluated by measuring a membrane without electrodes and a membrane-electrode-assembly under identical conditions. After 100 h of accelerated stress testing the proton conductivity of membrane samples near the anode and cathode was investigated by means of ex situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The membrane sample near the cathode inlet exhibited twofold lower membrane resistance and a resulting twofold higher proton conductivity than the membrane sample near the anode inlet. The results from the fluoride ion analysis have shown that the presence of platinum reduces the fluoride emission rate; which supports conclusions drawn from the literature.","621216","Open Access","0.3415","0.4038","1","Segmented cell","Segmented cell",3,NA,NA,"",""
