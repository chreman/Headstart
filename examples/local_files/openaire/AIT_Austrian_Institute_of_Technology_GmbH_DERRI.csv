An agent-based control system that coordinates the battery\ud charging of electric vehicles according to electric vehicle owner preferences,\ud distribution network technical limits and electricity prices was designed and\ud developed and its operation was tested experimentally.\ud The impact on grid demand peak increases at the national systems of Great Britain\ud and Spain was evaluated using low and high electric vehicle uptake levels of 7% and\ud 48.5% of the car fleet for the year 2030 with a deterministic method. It was found that\ud a low uptake will not raise significantly the grid demand peaks in both countries under\ud investigation. However, a high uptake will raise significantly the grid demand peaks.\ud The impact from residential electric vehicle battery charging on steady state voltages,\ud power line losses, transformers’ and cables’ loadings of distribution networks was\ud evaluated using a deterministic and a probabilistic method. It was found that low and\ud medium uptake levels of electric vehicles equivalent to 12.5% and 33% per residential\ud area of 384 customers in 2030, can be safely accommodated by reinforcing the\ud distribution network. A combination of reinforcements, installation of microgenerators\ud and control of electric vehicle battery charging will be required to\ud accommodate safely a high uptake of 71% with regards to the constraints studied.\ud An agent-based control system that coordinates the battery charging of electric\ud vehicles was designed and developed. Search techniques and neural networks were\ud used for the decision making processes. The ability of the agent-based control system\ud to operate successfully in both normal and abnormal conditions for the electrical\ud network was proved with experimental validation in the laboratory of Tecnalia\ud research institute in Spain.","241399","Open Access","0.5425","-0.1441","7","Distribution networks","Distribution networks",NA,NA,NA,"",""

However, there are situations where the use of RCCBs presents certain problems. In circuits that feed electronic loads RCCBs often cause nuisance tripping. This article discusses the reasons why RCCBs trip in this type of circuit based on a previous case studied by the authors at 'La Fe' hospital in Valencia (Spain) and several tests performed in a power flexible laboratory. A theoretical circuit used to explain the phenomena is also presented.

Fossil and biomass fuels were considered. The life-cycle emissions associated with the manufacturing, transport and disposal of micro-generators were calculated. Case studies were constructed, based on the literature. It was found that emissions associated with domestic electrical and thermal demand would be reduced significantly.\ud A Virtual Power Plant (VPP) was defined for aggregating micro-generators, using micro-generation penetration projections for the year 2030 from the literature. An optimisation problem was described, where the goal was to minimise the VPP carbon emissions. The results show the amount of emissions that would potentially be reduced by managing an existing micro-generation portfolio in a VPP.\ud An Environmental Virtual Power Plant (EVPP) was defined, for controlling micro-generator carbon emissions. A multi-agent system was designed. The principle of operation resembles an Emissions Trading Scheme. Emission allowances are traded by the micro-generators, in order to meet their emissions needs. Three EVPP control policies were identified. Fuzzy logic was utilised for the decision making processes. Simulations were performed to test the EVPP operation. The main benefit for the micro-generators is the ability to participate in markets from which they would normally be excluded due to their small size.\ud The multi-agent system was verified experimentally using micro-generation sources installed in two laboratories, in Athens, Greece. Two days of experiments were performed. Results show that system emissions have been successfully controlled, since only small deviations between desired and actual emissions output were observed. It was found that Environmental Virtual Power Plant controllability increases significantly by increasing the number of participating micro-generators.","228449","Open Access","0.0852","-0.544","5","","",NA,NA,"6","",""

In this context, throughout this paper PHIL simulations are performed to emulate the energy management system of a real microgrid including a diesel synchronous machine and inverter-based sources. Moreover, conventional frequency and voltage droops were incorporated into the respective inverters. The results were verified at the real microgrid installation in the Centre for Renewable Energy Sources (CRES) premises. This research work is divided into two steps: A) Real time in RSCAD/RTDS and Power Hardware-in-the-Loop (PHIL) simulations where the diesel generator´s active power droop control is evaluated, the battery inverter´s droop curves are simulated and the load sharing for parallel operation of the system´s generation units is examined. B) microgrid experiments during which various tests were executed concerning the diesel generator and the battery inverters in order to examine their dynamic operation within the LV islanded power system.

Different electric vehicle fleet sizes and network locations were considered.\ud The energy storage capacity and backup generator’s energy requirements were calculated to achieve daily energy balance in a low voltage distribution network with micro-generation. The effect of the electric vehicle battery demand as controllable loads on the backup generator energy requirements was assessed. It was found that the use of electric vehicles as controllable loads reduced the energy requirements from the backup generator or made it unnecessary to achieve energy balance.\ud Two control algorithms for the battery charging management of electric vehicles clustered in battery charging facilities were designed and developed. One algorithm calculates electric vehicle battery charging profiles for vehicles located in a parking space. Different charging policies were investigated, showing the ability of the control algorithm to define the electricity profile of the parking space according to network constraints and the policies’ objectives. The second algorithm calculates the number of batteries and chargers that are required to satisfy the battery demand of electric vehicle battery swapping stations. The impact of the number of chargers and batteries on the swapping station’s electricity load profile were evaluated.\ud An agent-based control system was designed and developed for the battery charging management of electric vehicles dispersed in distribution networks. The electric vehicle battery charging schedules are calculated according to electricity prices and distribution network technical constraints.\ud The real-time operation of the agent-based control system was demonstrated in the laboratory of TECNALIA’s research centre in Bilbao, Spain. A series of experiments showed the ability of the control system to operate and manage the electric vehicle battery charging when the distribution network is operated within its loading capacity and when the network technical limits are violated.","241399","Open Access","0.5131","0.0182","7","Distribution networks","Distribution networks",NA,NA,"","",""
