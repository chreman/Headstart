			This paper proposes two strategies for retransmission
			control of backlog traffic in the family of algorithms known
			as Network Diversity Multiple Access (NDMA). This type of
			algorithm has been shown to achieve (in ideal conditions) the
			following aspects: 1) collision-free performance for contentionbased
			traffic, 2) low latency values, and 3) reduced feedback
			complexity. These features match the machine-type traffic, realtime,
			and dense object connectivity requirements in 5G. This
			makes NDMA a candidate for contention traffic support in 5G
			systems. However, existing analysis ignores the effects of backlog
			traffic generated by the imperfect detection conditions that arise
			in settings with finite Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). This paper
			aims to partially fill this gap, by providing analytic expressions for
			the performance of symmetrical training-based NDMA protocols
			with two different types of backlog traffic retransmission schemes.
			In the first strategy, all terminals involved in an unsuccessful resolution
			period retransmit immediately in the subsequent resolution
			periods or epoch slots. This procedure is repeated continuously
			(persistent retransmission) by inducing the same collision event
			under different channel outcomes until all the contending signals
			are correctly detected and received. In the second retransmission
			strategy, the terminals in backlog state retransmit at a randomly
			selected time-slot with a probability that that is assumed (for
			simplicity) to match the transmission rate of the system. In
			both strategies, expressions are here obtained of the maximum
			stable throughput and the average delay experienced by any
			packet to be correctly received by the destination. This allows
			us to determine the capabilities of NDMA for achieving lowlatency,
			reduced feedback complexity, as well as highly stable
			and real-time throughout performance. The results shown here
			suggest that NDMA can achieve attractive low latency and high
			throughput figures mainly at high SNR values and moderate
			traffic loads.

			—This paper presents a resource allocation algorithm
			for multi-user wireless networks affected by co-channel interference.
			The analysis considers a network with one base station
			(BS) that uses a multiple antenna transmitter (beamformer) to
			schedule (in a time-division manner) transmissions towards a
			set of J one-antenna terminals in the presence of K persistent
			interferers. The transmitter is assumed to employ MaximumRatio
			Combining (MRC) beamforming with spatially-correlated
			branches and channel envelopes modelled as Rayleigh-distributed
			processes. The BS has access to an imperfect (outdated) copy
			of the instantaneous Channel State Information (CSI) of each
			terminal. Based on this CSI at the transmitter side (CSIT), the BS
			proceeds to select (at each time interval or time-slot) the terminal
			with the highest channel strength for purposes of transmission.
			This imperfect CSIT is also used to calculate the coefficients of the
			beamformer that will be used to transmit information towards the
			scheduled terminal, as well as for selecting the most appropriate
			modulation format (threshold-based decision). In addition, the
			transmission towards each scheduled terminal is assumed to
			experience persistent co-channel interference that will degrade
			the quality of the information reception process. The main merits
			of this work are the following: 1) joint analysis of MRC-based
			beamforming, terminal scheduling based on maximum channel
			strength, and modulation assignment, and 2) joint modelling
			of the effects of spatial correlation, co-channel interference
			and imperfect CSIT. Results suggest that scheduling helps in
			rejecting co-channel interference and the degrading effects of
			imperfect CSIT. Spatial correlation could some times lead to
			better performance than the uncorrelated case, particularly in the
			low SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) regime. Conversely, uncorrelated
			branches always outperform the correlated case in the high SNR
			regime. The use of higher numbers of antennas also improve
			performance of the system. However, spatial correlation tends
			to accumulate over the antenna array thus leading to a more
			noticeable performance degradation and more allocation errors
			due to the outdated CSIT assumption.

			SDRAM is a shared resource in modern multi-core platforms executing multiple real-time (RT) streaming applications. It is crucial to analyze the minimum guaranteed SDRAM bandwidth to ensure that the requirements of the RT streaming applications are always satisfied. However, deriving the worst-case bandwidth (WCBW) is challenging because of the diverse memory traffic with variable transaction sizes. In fact, existing RT memory controllers either do not efficiently support variable transaction sizes or do not provide an analysis to tightly bound WCBW in their presence.
			We propose a new mode-controlled data-flow (MCDF) model to capture the command scheduling dependencies of memory transactions with variable sizes. The WCBW can be obtained by employing an existing tool to automatically analyze our MCDF model rather than using existing static analysis techniques, which in contrast to our model are hard to extend to cover different RT memory controllers. Moreover, the MCDF analysis can exploit static information about known transaction sequences provided by the applications or by the memory arbiter. Experimental results show that 77% improvement of WCBW can be achieved compared to the case without known transaction sequences. In addition, the results demonstrate that the proposed MCDF model outperforms state-of-the-art analysis approaches and improves the WCBW by 22% without known transaction sequences.","147439","Open Access","-0.2779","0.4454","12","Memory controllers","Memory controllers",3,NA,NA,"",""

			This paper presents the design of an active flow control (AFC) system for commercial aircraft based on a dense wired/wireless sensor and actuator network. The goal is to track gradients of pressure across the surface of the fuselage of commercial aircraft. This collected information will be used to activate a set of actuators that will attempt to reduce the skin drag effect produced by the separation between laminar and turbulent flows. This will be translated into increased lift-off forces, higher speeds, longer ranges and reduced fuel consumption. The paper describes the architecture of the system in the context of the European research project DEWI (dependable embedded wireless infrastructure) using the concept of the DEWI Bubble. A simulator architecture is also proposed to model each process of the AFC system and the DEWI Bubble. To the best of our knowledge this is the first approach towards the use of wireless sensor technologies in the field of active flow control.

			Users need trusting in data managed by software applications that are part of Information Systems (IS), which supposes that organizations should assuring adequate levels of quality in data that are managed in their IS. Therefore, the fact that an IS can manage data with an adequate level of quality should be a basic requirement for all organizations. In order to reach this basic requirement some aspects and elements related with data quality (DQ) should be taken in account from the earliest stages of development of software applications, i.e. “data quality by design”. Since DQ is considered a multidimensional and largely context-dependent concept, managing all specific requirements is a complex task. The main goal of this paper is to introduce a specific methodology, which is aimed to identifying and eliciting DQ requirements coming from different viewpoints of users. These specific requirements will be used as normal requirements (both functional and non-functional) during the development of IS awareness of data quality.

			This paper presents the high-level architecture (HLA) of the research project DEWI (dependable embedded wireless infrastructure). The objective of this HLA is to serve as a reference for the development of industrial wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs) based on the concept of the DEWI Bubble. The DEWI Bubble is defined here as a high-level abstraction of an industrial WSAN with enhanced interoperability (via standardized interfaces), technology reuse, and cross-domain development. This paper details the design criteria used to define the HLA and the organization of the infrastructure inside and outside the DEWI Bubble. The description includes the different perspectives, models or views of the architecture: the entity model, the layered model, and the functional view model (including an overview of interfaces). The HLA constitutes an extension of the ISO/IEC SNRA (sensor network reference architecture) towards the support of industrial applications. To improve interoperability with existing approaches the DEWI HLA also reuses some features from other standardized technologies and architectures. The HLA will allow networks with different industrial sensor technologies to exchange information between them or with external clients via standard interfaces, thus providing a consolidated access to sensor information of different domains. This is an important aspect for smart city applications, big data and internet-of-things (IoT).

			Wireless technology is expanding to areas previously reluctant to the use of this type of technology. In the aeronautics industry, wireless has recently gained preference for on-board systems that conventionally used only cables. Recent interference and reliability studies with state-of-the-art standards suggest the feasibility of a relatively new research area that has been called wireless avionics intra-communications (WAICs). This paper presents a non-exhaustive survey of efforts in this emerging area. The objective is to identify topics, design issues, and synergies with other fields. The design of WAICs resembles some aspects of networks on ground, but it also adds some particular issues that remain to be addressed. This paper attempts to identify design issues of WAICs that range from physical-layer to application and security layers. Structure health monitoring, bus communications, and cable replacement, are examples of applications of WAICs.

			In this paper, we develop a framework for building context-aware applications in IoT. The IoT paradigm brings in various new issues such as macroprogramming, interoperability for heterogeneous devices and in-network processing. Solutions to these issues can enable IoT to support all available resources in an efficient manner and also enable ease of access for users. In addition, this can help in collecting useful information about the user and the system, such as context. Understanding context of different entities and taking actions accordingly will enable a context-aware IoT. However, no complete solution is available to this issue of achieving context-awareness in IoT. In this paper, as a step towards a context-aware framework, we present a mobilityenabling extension of the T-Res programming abstraction. We implement a web-based framework for users to write contextaware applications. We then describe and implement an automated mechanism for deploying these applications.

			In modern multi-core systems with multiple real-time (RT) applications, memory traffic accessing the shared SDRAM is increasingly diverse, e.g., transactions have variable sizes. RT memory controllers with dynamic command scheduling can efficiently address the diversity by issuing appropriate commands subject to the SDRAM timing constraints. However, the scheduling dependencies between commands make it challenging to derive tight bounds for the worst-case response time (WCRT) and the worst-case bandwidth (WCBW) of a memory controller. Existing modeling and analysis techniques either do not provide tight WCRT and WCBW bounds for diverse memory traffic with variable transaction sizes or are difficult to adapt to different RT memory controllers.
			This paper models a memory controller using Timed Automata (TA), where model checking is applied for analysis. Our TA model is modular and accurately captures the behavior of a RT memory controller with dynamic command scheduling. We obtain WCRT and WCBW bounds, which are validated by simulating the worst-case transaction traces obtained by model checking with a cycle-accurate model of the memory controller. Our method outperforms three state-of-the-art analysis techniques. We reduce WCRT bound by up to 20%, while the average improvement is 7.7%, and increase the WCBW bound by up to 25% with an average improvement of 13.6%. In addition, our modeling is generic enough to extend to memory controllers with different mechanisms.

			This paper presents a performance model of the packet reception process in a wireless link with one antenna

			performance evaluation of multiple antenna systems enabled with adaptive modulation and coding (AMC). Two
			main assumptions are used: 1) Rayleigh fading correlated channels, and 2) imperfect (outdated) channel state
			information at the transmitter side (CSIT). The results presented here suggest that spatial correlation not always
			affects the performance of the MRC receiver: at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), correlation can improve
			performance rather than degrading it. By contrast, at high SNR, correlation is found to always degrade
			performance. At high SNR, correlation tends to worse the degrading effects of imperfect CSIT, particularly when
			the number of antennas increases. Imperfect CSIT causes errors in the assignment of MCSs, thus reducing
			throughput performance. These errors become more evident at high SNR, particularly when the values of branch
			correlation and the number of antennas increase.","621353","Open Access","-0.6208","0.0571","5","Imperfect csit, Adaptive modulation, Fading correlated channels","Imperfect csit, Adaptive modulation, Fading correlated channels",0,NA,NA,"",""

			Network diversity multiple access (NDMA) is the family of algorithms with the highest potential throughput in the literature of signal-processing assisted random access protocols. NDMA uses the concept of protocol-induced retransmissions to create an adaptive source of diversity. This diversity is used to resolve packet collisions employing signal separation tools without the explicit need (or as a complement) of a multiple antenna receiver. This paper proposes a further improvement on the performance of NDMA by allowing each terminal access to an outdated copy of its individual channel state information (CSI). Based on this decentralized CSI, each terminal conveniently decides to transmit only if the estimated channel gain surpasses a threshold that is optimized to maximize performance. This ensures that the probability of terminal presence detection, and thus the probability of correct estimation of the collision multiplicity are considerably improved at the receiver end. The paper is focused on the modelling of the receiver operational characteristic (ROC) of the terminal presence detector considering that the CSI used by each terminal is potentially inaccurate (outdated) due to feedback delay. The results indicate that when the correlation coefficient that describes the accuracy of the available CSI tends to zero, the scheme degrades into the conventional NDMA. By contrast, when the quality of the channel state information improves, the throughput can nearly achieve the nominal channel rate (minimum throughput penalty).

Resources, such as off-chip DRAM, are typically shared between the applications using memory interconnects with different arbitration polices to cater to diverse bandwidth and latency requirements. However, traditional centralized interconnects are not scalable as the number of clients increase. Similarly, current distributed interconnects either cannot satisfy the diverse requirements or have decoupled arbitration stages, resulting in larger area, power and worst-case latency. The four main contributions of this article are: 1) a Globally Arbitrated Memory Tree (GAMT) with a distributed architecture that scales well with the number of cores, 2) an RTL-level implementation that can be configured with five arbitration policies (three distinct and two as special cases), 3) the concept of mixed arbitration policies that allows the policy to be selected individually per core, and 4) a worst-case analysis for a mixed arbitration policy that combines TDM and FBSP arbitration. We compare the performance of GAMT with centralized implementations and show that it can run up to four times faster and have over 51 and 37 percent reduction in area and power consumption, respectively, for a given bandwidth.","147439","Open Access","-0.4995","0.4972","15","2614","2614",0,NA,NA,"",""

			Network diversity multiple access or NDMA is the family of algorithms with the highest potential throughput in the literature of signal-processing-assisted random access. NDMA uses the concept of \emph{protocol-induced retransmissions} to create an adaptive source of physical (PHY) layer diversity. This adaptive diversity is used to resolve packet collisions (via signal separation) without the explicit need (or as a complement) of a multiple antenna receiver. This paper proposes a further improvement on the modelling of NDMA by considering the effects of imperfect channel and collision multiplicity estimation. In addition, this work considers channel correlation between consecutive retransmissions (i.e., temporal correlation). Conventionally, the analysis of NDMA assumes that any error in the collision multiplicity estimation translates into the loss of all contending packets. This is an optimistic assumption because even when the multiplicity has been correctly estimated, errors can still occur. On the other hand, it is also pessimistic because correct reception can also occur when the multiplicity has been incorrectly estimated. This paper presents a more detailed study of the performance of NDMA considering these more specific detection/reception cases.

This vast deployment necessitates collection and processing of large volume of measurement data. However, collecting all the measured data from individual devices on such a scale may be impractical and time consuming. Moreover, processing these measurements requires complex algorithms to extract useful information. Thus, it becomes imperative to devise distributed information processing mechanisms that identify application-specific features in a timely manner and with a low overhead.
			In this article, we present a feature extraction mechanism for dense networks that takes advantage of dominance-based medium access control (MAC) protocols to 
			(i) efficiently obtain global extrema of the sensed quantities, 
			(ii) extract local extrema, and (iii) detect the boundaries of events, by using simple transforms that nodes employ on their local data. We extend our results for a large dense network with multiple broadcast domains (MBD). We discuss and compare two approaches for addressing the challenges with MBD and we show through extensive evaluations that our proposed distributed MBD approach is fast and efficient at retrieving the most valuable measurements, independent of the number sensor nodes in the network.","621353","Open Access","0.1052","-0.6007","4","Wireless sensor networks","Wireless sensor networks",0,NA,NA,"",""

In this application, the role of the sensor network usually consists of obtaining a representation or a model of a physical phenomenon spreading through the affected area. In this work we focus on forest firefighting operations, proposing three fully distributed ways for approximating the actual shape of the fire. In the simplest approach, a circular burnt area is assumed around each node that has detected the fire and the union of these circles gives the overall fire’s shape. However, as this approach makes an intensive use of the wireless sensor network resources, we have proposed to incorporate two in-network aggregation techniques, which do not require considering the complete set of fire detections. The first technique models the fire by means of a complex shape composed of multiple convex hulls representing different burning areas, while the second technique uses a set of arbitrary polygons. Performance evaluation of realistic fire models on computer simulations reveals that the method based on arbitrary polygons obtains an improvement of 20% in terms of accuracy of the fire shape approximation, reducing the overhead in-network resources to 10% in the best case.","137228","Open Access","0.1111","-0.209","4","Wireless sensor networks","Wireless sensor networks",2,"1","3","",""

			contribution of this work lies in the derivation of analytic expressions (in terms of a series expansion) of the statistics of correct

			the joint modelling of spatially correlated branches, imperfect CSIT, and adaptive modulation based on threshold-trigger decision.
			Contrary to common belief, the results presented here suggest that spatial correlation not always afects the performance of the
			MRC receiver: at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), correlation can improve performance rather than degrading it. In contrast, at
			high SNR, correlation is found to always degrade performance. At high SNR, correlation tends to worse the degrading efects of
			imperfect CSIT, particularly when the number of antennas increases. Imperfect CSIT causes errors in the assignment of MCSs,
			thus reducing throughput performance. hese errors become more evident in the high SNR regime, particularly when the values

			This paper revisits the study of the Slotted ALOHA protocol with J = 2 terminals. Unlike previous approaches, this work employs multi-objective optimization tools. The work is focused on the characterization of the boundary (envelope) or Pareto optimal front curve of different types of trade-off region: the conventional throughput region, sum-throughput vs. fairness, and sum-throughput vs. transmit power. When possible, parametric and non-parametric expressions of these envelopes are here provided. Fairness is evaluated by means of the Gini-index, which is a metric used in economics to measure income inequality. Transmit power is directly linked to the global transmission rate. The approach presented in this paper generalizes previous works and provides more insights into the operation of random access protocols.","621353","Open Access","-0.3264","-0.6042","9","Aloha protocol, Fairness, Multi objective","Aloha protocol, Fairness, Multi objective",0,"2","0","",""
