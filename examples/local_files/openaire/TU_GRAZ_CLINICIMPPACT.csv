More precise, the approach belongs to the category of interactive contouring algorithms, which provide real-time feedback of the segmentation result. However, even with interactive real-time contouring approaches there are always cases where the user cannot find a satisfying segmentation, e.g. due to homogeneous appearances between the object and the background, or noise inside the object. For these difficult cases the algorithm still needs additional user support. However, this additional user support should be intuitive and rapid integrated into the segmentation process, without breaking the interactive real-time segmentation feedback. I propose a solution where the user can support the algorithm by an easy and fast placement of one or more seed points to guide the algorithm to a satisfying segmentation result also in difficult cases. These additional seed(s) restrict(s) the calculation of the segmentation for the algorithm, but at the same time, still enable to continue with the interactive real-time feedback segmentation. For a practical and genuine application in translational science, the approach has been tested on medical data from the clinical routine in 2D and 3D.","610886","Open Access","-0.3662","0.1068","1","Liver ablation zones, Algorithm for translational, Cut user guided","Liver ablation zones, Algorithm for translational, Cut user guided","4","13",6,"",""

The heat results from focusing energy in the radiofrequency spectrum through a needle. Amongst others, this can enable the treatment of patients who are not eligible for an open surgery. However, the possibility of recurrent liver cancer due to incomplete ablation of the tumor makes post-interventional monitoring via regular follow-up scans mandatory. These scans have to be carefully inspected for any conspicuousness. Within this study, the RF ablation zones from twelve post-interventional CT acquisitions have been segmented semi-automatically to support the visual inspection. An interactive, graph-based contouring approach, which prefers spherically shaped regions, has been applied. For the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the algorithmâ€™s results, manual slice-by-slice segmentations produced by clinical experts have been used as the gold standard (which have also been compared among each other). As evaluation metric for the statistical validation, the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) has been calculated. The results show that the proposed tool provides lesion segmentation with sufficient accuracy much faster than manual segmentation. The visual feedback and interactivity make the proposed tool well suitable for the clinical workflow.

Several algorithms were implemented including the mesh segmentation, offset surface generation, collision detection, ruled surface generation, etc., and a special software named TemDesigner was developed. With a simple user interface, a customized template can be semi- automatically designed according to the preoperative plan. Firstly, mesh segmentation with signed scalar of vertex is utilized to partition the inner surface from the input surface mesh based on the indicated point loop. Then, the offset surface of the inner surface is obtained through contouring the distance field of the inner surface, and segmented to generate the outer surface. Ruled surface is employed to connect inner and outer surfaces. Finally, drilling tubes are generated according to the preoperative plan through collision detection and merging. It has been applied to the template design for various kinds of surgeries, including oral implantology, cervical pedicle screw insertion, iliosacral screw insertion and osteotomy, demonstrating the efficiency, functionality and generality of our method.","600641","Open Access","0.4213","0.3209","2","","","4","20",5,"",""
