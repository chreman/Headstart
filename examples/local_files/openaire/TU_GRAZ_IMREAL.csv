This often requires substantial effort for fixing ontologies defects (e.g. inconsistency, unsatisfiability, missing or unintended implications, redundancy, isolated entities). The paper argues that ontology authoring tools should provide immediate semantic feedback upon entering ontological constructs. We present a framework to analyse input axioms and provide meaningful feedback at a semantic level. The framework has been used to augment an existing Controlled Natural Language-based ontology authoring tool – ROO. An experimental study with ROO has been conducted to examine users' reactions to the semantic feedback and the effect on their ontology authoring behaviour. The study strongly supported responsive intuitive ontology authoring tools, and identified future directions to extend and integrate semantic feedback.","257184","Open Access","0.3783","0.5862","8","Digital traces, Ontology authoring, Ontology modularisation","Digital traces, Ontology authoring, Ontology modularisation",NA,NA,NA,"",""

The use of digital traces to provide insight into human behavior remains underdeveloped. Recently, ontological approaches have been exploited for tagging and linking digital traces, with progress made in ontology models for well-defined domains. However, the process of conceptualization for ill-defined domains remains challenging, requiring interdisciplinary efforts to understand the main aspects and capture them in a computer processable form. The primary contribution of this article is a theory-driven approach to ontology development that supports semantic augmentation of digital traces. Specifically, we argue that (a) activity theory can be used to develop more insightful conceptual models of ill-defined activities, which (b) can be used to inform the development of an ontology, and (c) that this ontology can be used to guide the semantic augmentation of digital traces for making sense of phenomena. A case study of interpersonal communication is chosen to illustrate the applicability of the proposed multidisciplinary approach. The benefits of the approach are illustrated through an example application, demonstrating how it may be used to assemble and make sense of digital traces.","257831","Open Access","0.2584","0.4772","8","Digital traces, Ontology authoring, Ontology modularisation","Digital traces, Ontology authoring, Ontology modularisation","8","48","10","",""

			Online training is an increasingly important facet of the skills enhancing portfolio of any organization and has an especial place within life-long learning, career development and other self-regulated adult learning. We here present an overview of work towards developing online training, which is augmented by contextual cues, training which is personalized and adapted, in real-time, towards the learning objectives of the user, whilst supporting a wide range of meta-cognitive activities. This work brings technologies developed for the fantastical scenarios of serious gaming into the 'real world' - we also begin to address some of the underlying challenges in this transition.

We consider three popular platforms, Flickr, Delicious and StumbleUpon, and, by combining techniques from social network analysis with techniques from semantic analysis, we characterize the tagging behavior as well as the tendency to create friendship relationships of the users of these platforms. The aim of our investigation is to see if (and how) the features and goals of a given Social Sharing system reflect on the behavior of its users and, moreover, if there exists a correlation between the social and tagging behavior of the users. We report our findings in terms of the characteristics of user profiles according to three different dimensions: (i) intensity of user activities, (ii) tag-based characteristics of user profiles, and (iii) semantic characteristics of user profiles.","257831","Open Access","0.0279","-0.3533","1","Based user, Twitter based","Based user, Twitter based","4","2","5","",""
