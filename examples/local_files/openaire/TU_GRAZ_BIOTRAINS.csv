The streptavidin gene was inserted into the expression vector pPICZaA in frame with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae a mating factor secretion signal. In a fed batch fermentation using a minimal medium supplemented with trace amounts of biotin functional streptavidin was secreted at approximately 650mg/L of culture supernatant. This yield is approximately threefold higher than that from Escherichia coli and although the overall expression process takes longer (ten days vs. two days) the downstream processing is simplified by eliminating denaturing/refolding steps. The purified streptavidin bound ~3.2molecules of biotin per tetramer.

			Biocatalytic reactions have been identified as an outstanding option for various applications in material chemistry such as modifying surfaces under mild conditions, preparing polymers, controlling self-assembly systems and manufacturing (chiral) monomers. Mostly driven by research for producing bioactive compounds, ‘novel’ biocatalytic reactions have recently become mature enough to be exploited. While transformations involving lipases and laccases/peroxidases are already widely applied, more recent improved reactions allow the (asymmetric) amination of ketones/aldehydes, the oxidation of amines and alcohols, the asymmetric reduction of ketones, or the hydroxylation of alkanes and fatty acids. Many of these reactions are ready to be exploited for materials science.

The resulting hybrid can thus provide access to the best features of two distinct and often complementary systems: homogeneous and enzymatic catalysts. The coenzyme may be positioned with covalent dative or supramolecular anchoring strategies. Although initial reports date to the late 1970s artificial metalloenzymes for enantioselective catalysis have gained significant momentum only in the past decade with the aim of complementing homogeneous enzymatic heterogeneous and organic catalysts. Inspired by a visionary report by Wilson and Whitesides in 1978 we have exploited the potential of biotin avidin technology in creating artificial metalloenzymes. Owing to the remarkable affinity of biotin for either avidin or streptavidin covalent linking of a biotin anchor to a catalyst precursor ensures that upon stoichiometric addition of (strept)avidin the metal moiety is quantitatively incorporated within the host protein. In this Account we review our progress in preparing and optimizing these artificial metalloenzymes beginning with catalytic hydrogenation as a model and expanding from there. These artificial metalloenzymes can be optimized by both chemical (variation of the biotin spacer ligand moiety) and genetic (mutation of avidin or streptavidin) means. Such chemogenetic optimization schemes were applied to various enantioselective transformations. The reactions implemented thus far include the following: (i) The rhodium diphosphine catalyzed hydrogenation of N protected dehydroaminoacids (ee up to 95); (ii) the palladium diphosphine catalyzed allylic alkylation of 13 diphenylallylacetate (ee up to 95); (iii) the ruthenium pianostool catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of prochiral ketones (ee up to 97 for aryl alkyl ketones and ee up to 90 for dialkyl ketones); (iv) the vanadyl catalyzed oxidation of prochiral sulfides (ee up to 93). A number of noteworthy features are reminiscent of homogeneous catalysis including straightforward access to both enantiomers of the product the broad substrate scope organic solvent tolerance and an accessible range of reactions that are typical of homogeneous catalysts. Enzyme like features include access to genetic optimization an aqueous medium as the preferred solvent Michaelis Menten behavior and single substrate derivatization. The X ray characterization of artificial metalloenzymes provides fascinating insight into possible enantioselection mechanisms involving a well defined second coordination sphere environment. Thus such artificial metalloenzymes combine attractive features of both homogeneous and enzymatic kingdoms. In the spirit of surface borrowing that is modulating ligand affinity by harnessing existing protein surfaces this strategy can be extended to selectively binding streptavidin incorporated biotinylated ruthenium pianostool complexes to telomeric DNA. This application paves the way for chemical biology applications of artificial metalloenzymes.","238531","Closed Access","0.2933","0.366","7","Artificial metalloenzymes based, Combining biocatalysts, Enantioselective catalysis","Artificial metalloenzymes based, Combining biocatalysts, Enantioselective catalysis",196,NA,"148","",""

To fill this gap eight ADHs were investigated concerning their potential to reduce bulky 2-hydroxy ketones. All of these enzymes showed good activities along with excellent enantio( ee > 99%) and diastereoselectivities (de > 99%). Due to their differences in substrate preferences and stereoselectivity a broad range of diastereomerically pure 1,2-diols is now accessible via biotransformation. Best results were obtained using the alcohol dehydrogenase from Ralstonia sp. (Cupriavidus sp.) (RADH), which showed a broad substrate range, especially for sterically demanding compounds. Araliphatic 2-hydroxy ketones, like (R)-2-hydroxy-1-phenylpropan-1-one ((R)-2-HPP), were reduced much faster than aliphatic or aromatic aldehydes (e. g. benzaldehyde) under the applied conditions. Additionally (R)-as well as (S)-2-hydroxy ketones were converted with high diastereoselectivities (de > 99%).

The diastereoselective synthesis of cis-3-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)cyclohexanol was achieved by the Michael addition of imidazole to cyclohex-2-en-1-one under microwave conditions followed by reduction of the ketone. The racemic cis-alcohol obtained was successfully resolved through a lipase-catalysed kinetic resolution, Pseudomonas cepacia lipase proved to be a good biocatalyst for the exclusive acetylation of the (1R,3S)-cis enantiomer. Using the remaining (1S,3R)-cis alcohol enantiomer as a synthetic precursor, the optically active (1R,3R)-trans alcohol enantiomer was also prepared. The corresponding chiral salts and ionic liquids were obtained via quaternisation with alkyl halides, followed by anion exchange with inorganic salts. In this manner, a family of novel imidazolium-based ionic liquids was prepared, and their properties as phase-transfer catalysts in the Michael addition of diethyl malonate to trans-chalcone were analysed. The toxicity of these compounds against E. coli cells was also evaluated to understand their structural implications through the presented systematic synthetic approach.","238531","Open Access","-0.2959","0.3148","5","Based ionic liquids, Catalysed reactions, Dehydrogenase catalysed","Based ionic liquids, Catalysed reactions, Dehydrogenase catalysed",9,NA,NA,"",""

Analysis of the protein sequence revealed that it belongs to a group of BVMOs whose most characterized member is cyclopentadecanone monooxygenase (CPDMO). The gene was PCR amplified, cloned and successfully expressed in E. coli. The expressed recombinant enzyme was purified using metal affinity chromatography. Characterization of the purified enzyme revealed that it has a broad substrate scope and oxidized different compounds including substituted and unsubstituted alicyclic, bicyclic-, aliphatic-ketones, ketones with an aromatic moiety, and sulfides. The highest activities were measured for 2- and 3-methylcyclohexanone, phenylacetone, bicyclo-[3.2.0]-hept-2-en-6-one and menthone. The enzyme was optimally active at pH 7.5 and 35°C, a temperature at which its half-life was about 20 hours. The stability studies have shown that this enzyme is more stable than all other reported BVMOs except the phenylacetone monooxygenase from the thermophilic organism Thermobifida fusca.","238531","Open Access","0.7372","0.1369","10","Analysis bond, Bond cleaving, Cleaving enzyme","Analysis bond, Bond cleaving, Cleaving enzyme",6,NA,NA,"",""
