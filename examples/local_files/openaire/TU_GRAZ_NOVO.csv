Current research focuses on manipulating the physico-chemical properties of fibroin, and examining the effect of this manipulation on firobin's biocompatibility. Regenerated silk fibroin was modified by in vitro enzymatic phosphorylation and cast into films. Films were produced by blending, at several ratios, the phosphorylated and un-phosphorylated fibroin solutions. Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy was used to determine the specific P–OH vibration peak, confirming the phosphorylation of the regenerated silk fibroin solution. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that phosphorylation altered the intra- and inter-molecular interactions. Further experiments demonstrated that phosphorylation can be used to tailor the hydrophylicity/hydrophobicity ratio as well as the crystalinity of silk fibroin films. Release profiling of a model drug was highly dependent on silk modification level. Cytotoxicity assays showed that exposure to lixiviates of phosphorylated films only slightly affected cellular metabolism and proliferation, although direct contact resulted in a strong direct correlation between phosphorylation level and cell proliferation. This new method for tuning silk biomaterials to obtain specific structural and biochemical features can be adapted for a wide range of applications. Phosphorylation of silk fibroins may be applied to improve the cytocompatibility of any silk-based device that is considered to be in contact with live animals or human tissues.

This protective mode of growth allows them to resist antibiotic treatment and originates the majority of hospital-acquired infections. Emerging alternatives to control biofilm-associated infections and multidrug resistance development interfere with bacterial QS pathways, exerting less selective pressure on bacterial population. In this study, biologically stable coatings comprising the QS disrupting enzyme acylase were built on silicone urinary catheters using a layer-by-layer technique. This was achieved by the alternate deposition of negatively charged enzyme and positively charged polyethylenimine. The acylase-coated catheters efficiently quenched the QS in the biosensor strain Chromobacterium violaceum CECT 5999, demonstrated by approximately 50 % inhibition of violacein production. These enzyme multilayer coatings significantly reduced the Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145 biofilm formation under static and dynamic conditions in an in vitro catheterized bladder model. The quorum quenching enzyme coatings did not affect the viability of the human fibroblasts (BJ-5ta) over 7 days, corresponding to the extended useful life of urinary catheters. Such enzyme-based approach could be an alternative to the conventional antibiotic treatment for prevention of biofilm-associated urinary tract infections.

In this study, we report an innovative biotechnology-based approach for the covalent functionalization of silicone catheters with antifouling zwitterionic moieties to prevent biofilm formation. Our approach combines the potential bioactivity of a natural phenolics layer biocatalytically conjugated to sulfobetaine-acrylic residues in an enzymatically initiated surface radical polymerization with laccase. To ensure sufficient coating stability in urine, the silicone catheter is plasma-activated. In contrast to industrial chemical methods, the methacrylate-containing zwitterionic monomers are polymerized at pH 5 and 50 °C using as an initiator the phenoxy radicals solely generated by laccase on the phenolics-coated catheter surface. The coated catheters are characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) analysis, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and colorimetrically. Contact angle and protein adsorption measurements, coupled with in vitro tests with the Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus in static and dynamic conditions, mimicking the operational conditions to be faced by the catheters, demonstrate reduced biofilm formation by about 80% when compared to that of unmodified urinary catheters. The zwitterionic coating did not affect the viability of the human fibroblasts (BJ-5ta) over seven days, corresponding to the extended useful life of urinary catheters.

One strategy to manage the bacterial infections while avoiding the emergence of resistant strains implies specific targeting and disruption of bacteria membranes. This work evaluates the potential of nanostructured biopolymer derivatives, nanocapsules (NCs), to disrupt the bacteria cell walls and effectively kill planktonic microorganisms. Two biopolymers, chitosan and cellulose, were chemically modified to synthesize derivatives with improved cationic character (thiolated chitosan and aminocellulose) prior to their processing into nanocapsules via a one-step sonochemical process. The interactions of NCs, displaying an average size of around 250 nm, with bacteria membrane were evaluated using two membrane models: Langmuir monolayers and liposome bilayers composed of a l-a-phosphatidylglycerol phospholipid extracted from Escherichia coli. NCs possessed improved membrane disturbing capacity in comparison to the nonprocessed biopolymer derivatives, by drastically increasing the monolayer fluidity and inducing more than 50% leakage of a dye inserted in the bilayered liposomes. In addition, membrane disturbance was directly proportional to the NCs cationic charge. Whereas evidence showed that thiolated chitosan and aminocellulose interacted with the bacteria membrane through a “carpet model”, the NCs were found to induce larger surface defects and high local perturbance through a “detergent model”. Importantly, the degree of disruption caused by the biopolymer derivatives and NCs correlated well with the antimicrobial capacity against Escherichia coli, selectively killing bacteria cells without imparting toxicity to human fibroblasts.","278402","Restricted","-0.6219","0.1648","10",":enginyeria química [àrees temàtiques de la upc]",":enginyeria química [àrees temàtiques de la upc]","23",NA,NA,"",""

The phosphorylation content of matrix was controlled by mixing at specific ratios the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated solutions.

			The need for the material diversification is typically demanded in research and industry, and it stems from the particular applications of the given material. The current work describes three successful applications of in vitro enzymatic modification of fibrous materials. The chosen materials are silk fibroin (SF) from Bombyx mori (domesticated silkworm) and human hair keratin; the modification is phosphorylation with an ATP as a source of exogenous phosphate group. Protein kinase A from bovine source was the enzyme of choice. Natural fibrous materials are known for their outstanding mechanical properties, environmental stability, biocompatibility and shape control.
			In the last decades, the knowledge on both SF and keratin has considerably increased, regarding their fine structure and molecular biology, similarly to their practical applications in the field of biotechnology. Produced through sustainable, relatively simple and cheap processes, the natural fibrous materials are one of the main raw sources for biomaterial production. Unlike many biologically derived proteins, both silk and keratin are inherently stable to environmental changes and are mechanically robust. Silk and keratin contain several functional groups on the backbone and side chains of their constituting proteins, therefore exerting an ideal components for production of different protein-derived biomaterials.
			Therefore, it was of our interest to explore the possibility of “green” treatment of SF and keratin for biomedical (SF) and cosmetic (keratin) applications. The piece of evidence, presented in this thesis, strongly support the idea of enzymatically-mediated in vitro modification of both materials. Although high enzymatic specificity, accompanied by steric hindrance, resulted in somewhat low levels of phosphorylation, it was sufficient to cause considerable structural (SF) and chemical (SF and keratin) changes. The obtained results indicate that kinases can be potentially used to diversify both fibrous material types for a wide range of applications. This is particularly important in the fields of biocompatible devices, or any implementations, designed towards a contact with living tissue.
			A diversificação de materiais é normalmente necessária na indústria e investigação, devido ás aplicações específicas de um dado material. O presente trabalho descreve três aplicações bem sucedidas de modificação enzimática in vitro de materiais fibrosos. Os materiais escolhidos são fibroína de seda (SF) de Bombyx mori (bicho-da-seda domesticado) e queratina do cabelo humano; a modificação é a fosforilação com ATP como uma fonte exógena do grupo fosfato. A proteina quinase A de origem bovina foi a enzima escolhida. Materiais fibrosos naturais são conhecidos por suas excelentes propriedades mecânicas, estabilidade ambiental, biocompatibilidade e controlo de forma.
			Nas últimas décadas, o conhecimento sobre a SF e a queratina tem aumentado consideravelmente, quer em relação à sua estrutura microscópica e sua biologia molecular, quer às suas aplicações práticas no campo da biotecnologia. Produzido através de processos sustentáveis, relativamente simples e baratos, os materiais fibrosos naturais são uma das principais fontes de matérias para a produção de biomateriais. Ao contrário de muitas proteínas derivadas biologicamente, tanto a seda e a queratina são inerentemente estáveis a mudanças ambientais e são robustas mecanicamente. A seda e a queratina contêm vários grupos funcionais sobre as cadeias principais e laterais das proteínas que as constituem, exercercendo assim componentes ideais para a produção de diferentes biomateriais derivados de proteínas.
			Portanto, era do nosso interesse explorar a possibilidade do uso de tratamentos \"verdes\" de SF e queratina para aplicações biomédicas (SF) e para o desenvolvimento de cosméticos (queratina). As evidências, apresentadas nesta tese, apoiam fortemente a ideia da possibilidade de modificação in vitro mediada enzimáticamente de ambos materiais. Embora a alta especificidade enzimática, aliada ao impedimento estérico, resultou em níveis relativamente baixos de fosforilação, estes foram suficientes para causar alterações estruturais (SF) e químicas (SF e queratina) consideráveis. Os resultados obtidos indicam que quinases podem ser potencialmente utilizadas para diversificar ambos os tipos dos materiais fibrosos utilizados em uma ampla gama de aplicações. Tal consideração é particularmente importante nas áreas de dispositivos biocompatíveis, ou qualquer implementações, concebidos para um contacto com tecidos vivos.

Ultrasound irradiation through a liquid medium generates reactive free radical species, promoting a local turbulence/liquid microcirculation and enhancing the mass transport process rates.

Moreover, colonization of abiotic surfaces by microorganisms and the formation of biofilms is a major cause of infections associated with medical implants, resulting in prolonged hospitalization periods and patient mortality. In this study we describe a water-based synthesis of yttrium fluoride (YF3) nanoparticles (NPs) using sonochemistry. The sonochemical irradiation of an aqueous solution of yttrium (III) acetate tetrahydrate [Y(Ac)3 &amp;bull; (H2O)4], containing acidic HF as the fluorine ion source, yielded nanocrystalline needle-shaped YF3 particles. The obtained NPs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray elemental analysis. NP crystallinity was confirmed by electron and powder X-ray diffractions. YF3 NPs showed antibacterial properties against two common bacterial pathogens (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus) at a &amp;micro;g/mL range. We were also able to demonstrate that antimicrobial activity was dependent on NP size. In addition, catheters were surface modified with YF3 NPs using a one-step synthesis and coating process. The coating procedure yielded a homogeneous YF3 NP layer on the catheter, as analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. These YF3 NP-modified catheters were investigated for their ability to restrict bacterial biofilm formation. The YF3 NP-coated catheters were able to significantly reduce bacterial colonization compared to the uncoated surface. Taken together, our results highlight the potential to further develop the concept of utilizing these metal fluoride NPs as novel antimicrobial and antibiofilm agents, taking advantage of their low solubility and providing extended protection.Keywords: yttrium fluoride, nanoparticles, biofilms, antibacterial, catheter, sterile surfaces","278402","Open Access","-0.1421","-0.1061","6","Catheter","Catheter","4",NA,NA,"",""
