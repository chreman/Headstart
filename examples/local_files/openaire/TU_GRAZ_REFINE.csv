Plots of the storage and loss moduli against temperature show a significant shift of Tm to lower temperatures in the presence of CO2, indicating that the polymer crystals melt at temperatures much lower than the ambient pressure Tm. Furthermore, a significant decrease in the viscosity of two PCL grades with different molecular weight (Mn ~ 10 kDa and 80 kDa) was also detected upon increasing the CO2 pressure to 300 bar. Experimental viscosity data were fitted to the Carreau model to quantify the extent of the plasticising effects on the zero-shear viscosity and relaxation time under different conditions. Similar analyses were conducted under high-pressure nitrogen, to compare the effects obtained in the presence of a non-plasticising gas.","289253","Open Access","0.6848","-0.0928","2","Effects, Pressure, Viscosity","Effects, Pressure, Viscosity","12","2","17","",""

Here we report the synthesis of novel surface active polymers using cyclic esters (D,L-lactide) and temperature sensitive polyols (D-sorbitol) as renewable building blocks. We highlight the modification of chain length and degree of branching to provide a route to tailoring the properties and application performance of these new compounds. High processing temperatures (≥180 °C) and harsh post-reaction treatments are often needed to remove residual monomer and catalysts and these can become barriers to creating materials based on renewable resources. Here we exploit supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) as a green solvent to overcome these challenges; significantly reducing reaction temperatures, targeting controlled molecular weights with narrow dispersities and reducing sideproduct formation. Additionally in the same pot, we can use supercritical extraction to purify the compounds and to efficiently remove unreacted reagents, which could be recovered and recycled. We believe that our approach to the production and purification of these novel branched poly(lactides) is a significant step towards the development of the next generation of biopolymers and green surfactants, combining both the use of bio-sourced raw materials and the potential to use sustainable, low energy processes and techniques.","289253","Open Access","0.3516","-0.4502","1","Branched poly, Compounds, Purification","Branched poly, Compounds, Purification","2","3","14","",""

The block copolymers are characterised by 1H-NMR, GPC and DSC in order to carefully assess their structural and thermal properties. These polymers form self-assembled aggregates in aqueous environment and these nanostructures are studied through DLS, TEM and UV-Vis. Highly hydrophobic Coumarin-6 was used as a model to prove dispersion in water of lipophilic molecules. Maximum bubble pressure tests demonstrate the reduction in surface tension of these polymers and comparisons are made directly to commercial polymeric non-ionic surfactants.","289253","Open Access","0.2462","-0.0684","4","Based amphiphilic","Based amphiphilic","3","2","15","",""
