			Photovoltaic (CPV) modules. Component cells with the same optical behavior as MJ solar cells are used to characterize the spectrum. A set of parameters, namely Spectral Matching Ratios (SMRs), is used to characterize spectrally a particular Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) by comparison to the reference spectrum (AM1.5D-ASTM-G173-03). Furthermore, the spectrally corrected DNI for a given MJ solar cell technology is defined providing a way to estimate the losses associated to the spectral variations. The last section analyzes how the spectrum evolves throughout a year in a given place and the set of SMRs representative for that location are calculated. This information can be used to maximize the energy harvested by the MJ solar cell throughout the year. As an example, three years of data recorded in Madrid shows that losses lower than 5% are expected due to current mismatch for state-of-the-art MJ solar cells.","262533","Open Access","0.2689","-0.5158","4","Energías renovables","Energías renovables","",NA,NA,"",""

Deploying different stress levels allows determination of an equivalent stress dose function, which is a first step towards a lifetime prediction of devices. The derived humidity dose is used to characterise the degradation of power as well as that of the solar cell's equivalent circuit parameters calculated from measured current–voltage characteristics. An application of this to the samples demonstrates different modes in the degradation and thus enables better understanding of the module's underlying ageing mechanisms. The analysis of changes in the solar cell equivalent circuit parameters identified the primary contributors to the power degradation and distinguished the potential ageing mechanism for each types of module investigated in this paper. © 2016 The Authors.

Different approaches have been considered, including a linear model, lumped elements models and models that make use of commercial software solvers. The validation of the models performed by comparing the results of simulations with experimental data recorded on a test bench over an entire year is presented and discussed on a seasonal basis. The results have shown that all the models implemented allow achieving a good prediction of the PV modules back surface temperature, with the minimum value of the coefficient of determination R2 around 95% on a yearly basis. Moreover, the influence of season weather conditions and of the incident solar irradiance magnitude on the accuracy of the considered thermal models is highlighted. The major result of the present study is represented by the fact that it has been possible to perform a better thermal characterization of the BIPV module by tuning some of the heat transfer coefficients, such as those relative to the effects of the wind velocity, and to the evaluation of sky temperature.

The use of spectroheliometers has been proved useful to establish the necessary spectral conditions to perform power rating of CPV modules and systems.
