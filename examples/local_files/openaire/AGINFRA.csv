The project is developing a data infrastructure to support agricultural scientific communities through promoting data sharing and the development of trust in agricultural sciences.\ud \ud Members of the project are working to provide tools, hosted in a scientific gateway, for creating a linked open data environment for agricultural scientists. The project will try to remove existing obstacles concerning open access to scientific information (including discovery and use of the data) in agriculture. The project consortium also seeks to improve the preparedness of the agricultural scientific community to face, manage and exploit the abundance of relevant data that is (or will become) available to agricultural researchers as data becomes more openly available.\ud \ud It is intended that the project will promote research on food and agriculture, including research to adapt to, and mitigate climate change, and access to research results and technologies at national, regional and international levels. The overall aim of the project being to improve access to knowledge by creating a high level of interoperability between agricultural and other data resources.","","English","","2013-10-01","","publication","-0.0376","0.0511","1","Agricultural communities, Computing resources","Agricultural communities, Computing resources","",""

It provides access to literature drawn from across the world, and its archives document the Earth as it was one hundred years ago and more. However, this strength of BHL is also its weakness: the breadth of coverage of BHL can complicate finding relevant literature. In this short paper, we will explore the practical issues arising from attempting to filter out relevant legacy literature to support agricultural research.","","English","Springer International Publishing","2014-11-01","10.1007/978-3-319-13674-5_18","publication","0.5382","0.1733","1","Agricultural communities, Computing resources","Agricultural communities, Computing resources","",""

It is supported by a large community of data providers, partners and users. AGRIS is a database that aggregates bibliographic data, and through this core data, related content across online information systems is retrieved by taking advantage of Semantic Web capabilities. AGRIS is a global public good and its vision is to be a responsive service to its user needs by facilitating contributions and feedback regarding the AGRIS core knowledgebase, AGRIS?s future and its continuous development. Periodic AGRIS e-consultations, partner meetings and user feedback are assimilated to the development of the AGRIS application and content coverage. This paper outlines the current AGRIS technical set-up, its network of partners, data providers and users as well as how AGRIS?s responsiveness to clients? needs inspires the continuous technical development of the application. The paper concludes by providing a use case of how the AGRIS stakeholder input and the subsequent AGRIS e-consultation results influence the development of the AGRIS application, knowledgebase and service delivery.","F1000Research","English","F1000 Research Ltd","2015-05-01","10.12688/f1000research.6354.1","publication","-0.5794","0.1365","1","Agricultural communities, Computing resources","Agricultural communities, Computing resources","",""
