Electron microscopic pictures of cells from individual cascade stages (R1?R5) were converted to binary pictures to visualize footprint areas for polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) and non-PHA biomass. Results for each stage were correlated to the corresponding experimentally determined kinetics (specific growth rate ? and specific productivity ?). Log-normal distribution describes PHA granule size dissimilarity, whereas for R1 and R4, gamma distribution best reflects the situation. R1, devoted to balanced biomass synthesis, predominately contains cells with rather small granules, whereas with increasing residence time ?, maximum and average granule sizes by trend increase, approaching an upper limit determined by the cell?s geometry. Generally, an increase of intracellular PHA content and ratio of granule to cell area slow down along the cascade. Further, the number of granules per cell decreases with increasing ?. Data for ? and ? obtained by binary picture analysis correlate well with the experimental results. The work describes long-term continuous PHA production under balanced, transient, and nutrient-deficient conditions, as well as their reflection on the granules size, granule number, and cell structure on the microscopic level.

CGP was assessed by comparison with the application of pure glycerol. Applying pure glycerol, a copolyester with a molar fraction of 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) of 0.90â€‰mol/mol and 3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV) of 0.10â€‰mol/mol, was produced at a volumetric productivity of 0.12â€‰g/Lh and an intracellular PHA content of 75.4â€‰wt.-% in the sum of biomass protein plus PHA. Application of CGP resulted in the same polyester composition and volumetric productivity, indicating the feasibility of applying CGP as feedstock. Analysis of molar mass distribution revealed a weight average molar mass M w of 150â€‰kDa and polydispersity P i of 2.1 for pure glycerol and 253â€‰kDa and 2.7 for CGP, respectively; melting temperatures ranged between 130 and 140Â°C in both setups. Supplying Î³ -butyrolactone as 4-hydroxybutyrate (4HB) precursor resulted in a poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-(R)-3-hydroxyvalerate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate] (PHBHV4HB) terpolyester containing 3HV (0.12â€‰mol/mol) and 4HB (0.05â€‰mol/mol) in the poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] (PHB) matrix; in addition, this process runs without sterilization of the bioreactor. The terpolyester displayed reduced melting (melting endotherms at 122 and 137Â°C) and glass transition temperature (2.5Â°C), increased molar mass (391â€‰kDa), and a polydispersity similar to the copolyesters.","245084","Open Access","-0.3935","-0.4771","5","Archaeal production, Biodiesel industry derived, Bio mediated incorporation","Archaeal production, Biodiesel industry derived, Bio mediated incorporation",41,NA,NA,"",""

As a prerequisite, optimized process design is needed to make PHAs attractive in terms of costs and quality. Nowadays, large-scale PHA production relies on discontinuous fed-batch cultivation in huge bioreactors. Such processes presuppose numerous shortcomings such as nonproductive time for reactor revamping, irregular product quality, limited possibility for supply of certain carbon substrates, and, most of all, insufficient productivity. Therefore, single- and multistage continuous PHA biosynthesis is increasingly investigated for production of different types of microbial PHAs; this goes for rather crystalline, thermoplastic PHA homopolyesters as well as for highly flexible PHA copolyesters, and even blocky-structured PHAs consisting of alternating soft and hard segments. Apart from enhanced productivity and constant product quality, chemostat processes can be used to elucidate kinetics of cell growth and PHA formation under constant process conditions. Furthermore, continuous enrichment processes constitute a tool to isolate novel powerful PHA-producing microbial strains adapted to special environmental conditions. The article discusses challenges, potential and case studies for continuous PHA production, and shows up new strategies to further enhance such processes economically by developing unsterile open continuous processes combined with the application of inexpensive carbon feedstocks.","245084","Open Access","-0.2177","-0.1896","3","Animal based, Based waste, Biomediated pha","Animal based, Based waste, Biomediated pha",9,NA,NA,"",""

For proof of concept, pre-experiments were carried out on a shake flask scale using different mixtures of glucose and LW as carbon source. The results indicate that LW definitely acts as a 3HV precursor, but, at the same time, displays toxic effects on C. necator at concentrations exceeding 10 g/L. Based on these findings, PHA biosynthesis under controlled conditions was performed using a fed-batch feeding regime on a bioreactor scale. As major outcome, a poly(3HB-co-0.8%-3HV) copolyester was obtained displaying a desired high molar mass of M-w = 5.39 x 10(5) g/mol at low molar-mass dispersity (D-M of 1.53), a degree of crystallinity (X-c) of 62.1%, and melting temperature T-m (176.3 degrees C) slightly lower than values reported for poly([R]-3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) homopolyester produced by C. necator; thus, the produced biopolyester is expected to be more suitable for polymer processing purposes.","245084","Open Access","0.0336","-0.156","5","Archaeal production, Biodiesel industry derived, Bio mediated incorporation","Archaeal production, Biodiesel industry derived, Bio mediated incorporation",9,NA,NA,"",""
