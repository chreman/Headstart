This tool implements a modiﬁed version of VIPS with the aim of enhancing the precision of visual block extraction and the hierarchy construction. First, the visual rendering of a page, produced by several browsers, is segmented into rectangular blocks. Then, the extracted blocks are analysed looking for visual overlaps, which are analysed using a adapted version of the XY-Cut algorithm and resolve the overlap. As a result we may have diﬀerent shapes of blocks, rectangular and non-rectangular blocks. Finally, the visual block tree, representing the layout of the page is analysed in order to have a more coherent layout disposition.","270137","Open Access","0.5653","0.4032","9","Segmentation tool","Segmentation tool",NA,NA,NA,"",""

In particular, we must be able to capture performance dependency requirements, i.e. to identify the other resources that are required in order for the intended interpretation to be constructed successfully. Critically, we must identify the digital objects that are only referenced in the source data, but are embedded in the performance, such as fonts. This paper describes a new technique for analysing the dynamic dependencies of digital media, focussing on analysing the process that underlies the performance, rather than parsing and deconstructing the source data. This allows the results of format-specific characterisation tools to be verified independently, and facilitates the generation of representation information for any digital media format, even when no suitable characterisation tool exists.","270137","Open Access","0.1291","0.096","13","D.2.8","D.2.8",NA,NA,NA,"",""

The execution of a preservation action has  the  purpose  of  supporting  the  continuous  access  to  content  or  to  make  sure  that  digital preservation  is  being  carried  out  effectively  (Ferreira,  Baptista,  &  Ramalho,  2006).  For  example,  a migration of content from an obsolete format to a more up‐to‐date one, the replacement of a viewer application  in  some  rendering  environment,  the  execution  of  legacy  software  in  an  emulation environment, etc.  
			Preservation  actions  have  been  extensively  analysed  and  employed  in  experimental  digital preservation  systems  (Eld  Zierau  &  Caroline  van  Wijk,  2008;  Ferreira,  Baptista,  &  Ramalho,  2007). However,  current  approaches  are  not  capable  of  coping  with  real‐size  collections  of  today’s preservation  environments,  e.g.  an  e‐journal  library  may  contain  several  thousands  of  documents adding up to several terabytes of information. A national‐wide Web archiving service will contain a myriad of unrelated formats and can easily host Petabytes of data.  The  Work  package  WP10  of  SCAPE  project  (i.e.  Action  Services  Components)  is  focused  on  the applicability  of action tools and services to large  collections of  complex digital objects by analysing and  improving  interfaces  and  internal  functionality  of  existing  software  tools,  extending  them  and creating  new  functionality  to  cope  with  large‐scale  digital  preservation  scenarios.  Within  this  work package, tools will be enhanced to deal with, not only single file formats, but also compound objects, 
			large‐sized objects and large collections of digital objects.

The motivating force of the SCAPE project is scalability, interpreted in several dimensions: number of objects, size of objects, complexity of objects, and heterogeneity of collections.

The work aims to demonstrate that a preservation ecosystem composed of building blocks as the ones developed in SCAPE is able to comply with most of the system-related requirements of the ISO 16363.

			The SCAPE Preservation Environment (SPE) is composed of a repository system, an execution environment, planning & watch services, preservation control policies, and best practice guidelines and reports. From a total of 108 metrics included in the ISO 16363, the SPE fully supports 69 of them. 31 metrics were considered to be “out of scope” as they refer to organisational issues that cannot be solved by technology alone nor can they be analysed outside the framework of a breathing organisation, leaving 2 metrics to be considered “partially supported” and 6 metrics to be considered “not supported”. This gives an overall compliancy level of roughly 90% (if the organisational oriented metrics are not taken into account).

			Even though we consider this to be an excellent result, proving and giving guidelines on how it would be possible to have a system compliant with most of the metrics included in ISO 16363, this also enabled us to identify the main weak points of the SCAPE Preservation Environment that should be addressed in the near future. In summary the gaps found were:

			The ability to manage and maintain contracts or deposit agreements through the repository user interfaces;
			Support for tracking intellectual property rights;
			Improve technical documentation, especially on the conversion of Submission Information Packages (SIP) into Archival Information Packages (AIP);
			The ability to aid the repository manager to perform better risk management.
			Our goal is to ensure that the SCAPE Preservation Environment fully supports the system-related metrics of the ISO 16363. In order to close the gaps encountered, additional features have been added to the roadmap of the SPE.

For example, the use of encryption may result in content becoming inaccessible over time, and files that have dependencies on external resources (e.g. fonts that are not embedded) may not be rendered correctly. Such features are potential preservation risks, and for digital archives it is important to be aware of the fact what risks are associated with a specific format, and how files can be assessed for the presence of a risk. The overall aim of this deliverable is to address this situation by presenting an open knowledge base of format-specific preservation risks.

			This was realised by creating a platform that is called the OPF File Format Risk Registry (FFRR), which is part of the Open Planets Knowledge Base Wiki. For a given format, FFRR lists the risks that are associated with it, it provides information on how to test if a file is affected a risk, and it gives recommendations on how to deal with file objects that are affected by a risk. It also provides evidence in the form of sample files. FFRR content was created for the formats JP2 (JPEG 2000 Part 1) and PDF. These formats were chosen because of their particular importance to other SCAPE partners, and they are used here as a proof of concept of the FFRR approach. Research was done on tools that are able to detect preservation risks for these formats. The results of this research were included in FFRR. As no suitable tool existed for JP2, a new tool was developed for this format. As file format risks may be explicitly addressed by institutional policies, a general methodology was developed for an automated assessment (or validation) of files against a policy.","270137","Open Access","-0.0732","0.49","7","Digital preservation","Digital preservation","",NA,NA,"",""
