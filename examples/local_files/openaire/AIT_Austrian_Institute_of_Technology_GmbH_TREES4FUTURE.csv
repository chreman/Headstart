Development of clonal propagation method, such as somatic embryogenesis has potentially numerous applications such as the production of a large number of genetically improved plants and the amenability of embryogenic cultures to cryogenie storage. Since the 90's, INRA engaged researches on somatic embryogenesis in hybrid larch species (Larix x eurolepis, Larix x marschlinsii). lndeed, compared to the parental species, the hybrids are known for
			their remarkable vigour as weil as for their superior stem form and site adaptation (Pâques 1992). Several improvements and simplifications of somatic embryogenesis protocol were developed at all steps including initiation, cryopreservation, maturation and plant recovery. The improved procedure for somatic embryogenesis of Larix species leads to well-synchronised somatic embryo development. Mature cotyledonary SE most closely resemble zygotic embryo counterpart (anatomy, proteins content). [br/]
			Among conifer species, somatic embryogenesis of Larix is becoming a model; its integration in a breeding programme is now undertaken for clonal propagation of improved material of hybrid larch Larix x eurolepis (Lelu-Walter and Pâques 2009). lndeed, we believe that somatic embryogenesis should influence breeding strategies by offering an alternative tool for accelerated production of plants for genotype evaluation through clonal testing; in addition, cryoconservation allows keeping juvenility of material and its production at any time. Requirements for the effective integration of somatic embryogenesis into the larch breeding programme are presented.","284181","Open Access","0.2568","-0.5769","7","Somatic embryogenesis","Somatic embryogenesis",NA,NA,NA,"",""

Constituye  gran  parte  del  estrato  arbóreo  de  dehesas  o  montados,  produce  bellota como alimento del ganado y establece simbiosis con hongos micorrizógenos de gran  valor económico. La encina está considerada como una especie recalcitrante en términos de  conservación  de  semillas  y  capacidad  morfogénica,  lo  que  dificulta  los  programas  de  conservación de recursos  genéticos y la mejora de la especie.  La  propagación vegetativa es  una  potente  herramienta  de  los  programas  de  mejora,  por  lo  que  es  preciso  desarrollar  protocolos de regeneración somática en encina. La embriogénesis somática está considerada  como la modalidad más  adecuada de  regeneración  basada  en  técnicas de cultivo de tejidos  vegetales  utilizada  en  biotecnología  forestal.

La  embriogénesis somática se indujo  en tegumentos  maternos de óvulos en desarrollo  procedentes  de bellotas  inmaduras  de  encinas  adultas.  A  pesar de las  bajas  frecuencias  de  inducción,  las  líneas  embriogénicas  generadas  se  amplificaron  mediante  embriogénesis  secundaria  observándose  cierta  pérdida  de  la  capacidad  de  diferenciación  con  el  tiempo.  Tanto  el  genotipo  como  la  formulación  del  medio  de  cultivo  influyeron  en  la  respuesta  embriogénica,  concluyendo  que la  formulación  de  macronutrientes  de  Schenk  y Hildebrant  del medio sin reguladores de crecimiento fue la combinación más efectiva en la inducción. Los  resultados sugirieron la existencia de una ventana en el desarrollo del óvulo más sensible a la  inducción. El genotipo in[luyó en la capacidad proliferativa de los cultivos y en la conversión  de los  embriones  somáticos,  que se incrementó  suplementando  el  medio  con ácido  indol-3-butírico y 6-benciladenina. El  cultivo  en  medio  líquido  de  líneas  embriogénicas  en  condiciones  de  inmersión  transitoria incrementó  el  crecimiento,  dependiendo  del genotipo,  con respecto  al cultivo en  medio  semisólido.  Sin  embargo,  no  mejoró  la  capacidad  de  diferenciar  embriones  cotiledonares aislados.  Se estableció  un protocolo  de inicio  y mantenimiento  de cultivos en  suspensión  para  varias  líneas  embriogénicas  mediante  inoculación  en  alta  densidad  de  agregados embrionarios procedentes del medio semisólido. Para evitar la pérdida de vigor y la capacidad morfogénica debida al cultivo prolongado  se  desarrolló  un  protocolo  de  crioconservación  de  líneas  embriogénicas  mediante  vitrificación. Al determinar la influencia de los agentes crioprotectores antes y después de su  inmersión en nitrógeno líquido se concluyó que las respuestas de capacidad de crecimiento y  de  diferenciación  del  material  embriogénico  son  independientes,  además  de  estar  bajo  influencia del  genotipo  y el  tipo  de material  crioconservado. La combinación de sacarosa  y PVS2 previa a la inmersión en nitrógeno  líquido proporcionó la mayor tasa de recuperación.

SSR y RAPD mostraron importantes diferencias genéticas entre los árboles donantes y el material  embriogénico  que  dependieron  del  genotipo.  El  grado  de  detección  dependió  del marcador empleado.  Ambos marcadores revelaron baja inestabilidad intraclonal. Los RAPD revelaron variación genética intra-individuo en las encinas donantes.

ABSTRACT Holm oak (Quercus ilex L.) is one of the most important Mediterranean forest species. It  conforms the tree layer of dehesas or montados,  it  produces  acorns to  feed  the  livestock  and  it  establishes  symbiosis  with  profitable  mycorrhizal  fungi.  Holm  oak  is  considered  as  recalcitrant  species  in  terms  of  seed  conservation  and  morphogenic  capacities,  which  complicates the development of genetic conservation and improvement programs. Vegetative  propagation  is  one  of  the  mightiest  tools  for  breeding  programs  therefore;  developing  protocols  for  clonal  regeneration  of  holm  oak  is  essential.  Somatic  embryogenesis  is  considered the best  tissue culture-based way of plant  regeneration in forest  biotechnology.  The present  study  is  focused on the  study of certain  aspects  of somatic  embryogenesis  for  clonal  regeneration  of  mature  holm  oak.  This  thesis  manuscript  is  divided  into  several  chapters that match with different aspects of the embryogenic system.  Somatic embryogenesis induction was achieved on maternal  teguments of developing  ovules from immature acorns of adult holm oak trees. Despite the low induction frequencies,  the generated embryogenic  lines  were amplified by  secondary embryogenesis.  A decline  in  the differentiation capacity over time was also observed. It was concluded that both genotype  and culture  media formulation  influenced the embryogenic response,  being the Schenk  and  Hildebrandt´s macronutrients formulation from culture medium and the lack of plant growth  regulators the most effective combination for the induction of the embryogenic  response.  It  has  been suggested the existence of a developmental  window in which ovules are prone  to  induction. Genotype influenced the proliferation capacity and the plant conversion of somatic  embryos,  which  was  also  favoured  by  the  presence  of  indol-3-butyric  acid  and  6-bencyladenine. The  use  of  temporary  immersion  systems  as  proliferation  in  liquid  culture  of  the  embryogenic lines increased the growth depending on genotype, when compared to semisolid  cultures.  However,  it  did not  improve the differentiation of single cotyledonary  embryos.  A  protocol  for  the  initiation  and  maintenance  of  embryogenic  suspension  cultures  was  established for several embryogenic lines with highly dense inoculi  of embryogenic  clusters  from proliferating semisolid cultures. In order to avoid the loss of vigour and morphogenic ability of embryogenic lines due to  prolonged cultures, a cryopreservation protocol for embryogenic lines of holm oak  has been  developed. During the determination of the influence of cryoprotective agents on the growth  and differentiation capacities  before and after  liquid nitrogen immersion, it was  concluded  that  both  responses  were  independent  from  each  other  and  also  under  the  influence  of  genotype and the type of cryopreserved material. The combination of sucrose and PVS2 prior  liquid nitrogen immersion provided higher recovery rates. When the same embryogenic lines were  cryopreserved  for  30  days,  none  was  able  to  differentiate.  The  SSRs  analysis  of  the  short-term cryopreserved material detected somaclonal variation. Both  SSR  and  RAPD  markers  showed  high  sensitivity  to  detect  genetic  differences  between the donor trees and the generated embryogenic material. Nevertheless, the degree of  instability  detection  depended  on  the  marker.  The  SSR  analysis  indicated  a  relationship  between  genotype,  the  studied  loci  and  the  located  polymorphisms.  Also,  both  markers  revealed low  intraclonal genetic  variation.  The  RAPD  detected  genetic  variation within the  donor trees. The presence of pre-existent genetic variation within mature trees, in addition to  its  occurrence  during  the  early  stages  of  the  embryogenic  induction,  and  the  presence  of  tissues of fertilisation origin within the maternal explants are all discussed. Nonetheless, the  determination  of  the  genetic  identity  of  donor  material  is  required,  in  addition  to  early  detection methods of somaclonal variation.","284181","Open Access","0.628","-0.2921","7","Somatic embryogenesis","Somatic embryogenesis",NA,NA,NA,"",""

			Cork structural characteristics and their influence on the oxygen ingress through wine stoppers 
			were studied aiming to contribute to an increased added-value of the natural cork stoppers. 
			The surface porosity features of cork stoppers can differentiate the three main commercial 
			classes used nowadays: the porosity coefficient was 2.4%, 4.0% and 5.5% for premium, good 
			and standard stoppers, respectively.  Image analysis also distinguished defects in the cork 
			structure: empty ant gallery; Coroebus undatus F. larvae gallery; and wetcork. Several 
			predictive classification models of stoppers into quality classes were built using the results 
			from cork stoppers surface characterization and a simplified model using the main 
			discriminant features i.e. porosity coefficient and the RGB colour-type variables was 
			presented.  
			X-ray tomography was used as a non-destructive technique to study the internal structure of 
			natural cork stoppers, allowing the visualization of some defects inside the cork stopper. After 
			characterization, the natural cork stoppers were used as closure of bottles and oxygen 
			diffusion measurements were made along time. The kinetics of oxygen transfer was similar 
			and could be adjusted to logarithmic models. On average 35% of the overall oxygen ingress occurred in the first 5 days, 59% in the 1st month and 78% in the first 3 months.  
			Microtomography images (voxel size of 50 µm) allowed the observation of lenticular channels 
			development and geometry, and the quantification of void and high density regions (HDR) 
			fractions. The evidence that the void fraction of lenticular channels in the innermost part of 
			the cork stopper inserted in the bottle was strongly related to the oxygen ingress in the first 
			month after bottling can be used for quality enhancement of natural cork stoppers with

			Portugal constitui o limite mais ocidental da distribuição de Pinus sylvestris L. (pinheiro-silvestre). As alterações climáticas globais estão a afetar os ecossistemas florestais estão a ocorrer mais rápido que o tempo necessário à adaptação das árvores. As populações periféricas (situadas em limites de distribuição de uma espécie) têm sido estudadas ao nível da conservação, e constituem reservatórios de elevada diversidade genética intra-específica, além de terem regimes de seleção natural daqueles verificados nas populações centrais. A 'Serra do Gerês' pode ter sido um refúgio para P. sylvestris durante a última era glacial e algumas das populações atuais presentes em áreas ribeirinhas podem ser núcleos remanescentes das potenciais populações nativas.
			Este trabalho foi desenvolvido no âmbito do projeto da FCT: “Scots pine in Portugal: the Southwest end or just the end” (PTDC/AGR-CFL/110988/2009). O seu principal objetivo foi apoiar ou refutar a hipótese da origem nativa das populações Portuguesas de pinheiro-silvestre localizadas na 'Serra do Gerês' com base em marcadores microssatélite (SSR) (Capítulo II) e na localização física de sequências de DNA repetitivas através de hibridação in situ fluorescente (FISH) não desnaturante (ND-FISH) e FISH (Capítulo III).
			Durante a presente pesquisa, foram analisados cinco loci SSR cloroplastidiais (cpSSR) e quatro loci nucleares SSR (nSSR) em DNA genómico de 96 indivíduos pertencentes às populações da 'Serra do Gerês' - 'Ribeira das Negras' e 'Biduissa' - e a quatro populações europeias representativas da distribuição desta espécie. Todos os loci nSSR e cpSSR se revelaram altamente polimórficos. A análise Bayesiana identificou um número relevante de clusters K=3. As proporções de mistura da análise Bayesiana e as análises de coordenadas principais diferenciaram as populações Portuguesas entre si e das restantes populações. A totalidade dos dados SSR evidenciou que as populações Portuguesas da 'Serra do Gerês' têm origens diferentes comparativamente às estrangeiras, confirmando a sua origem autóctone.
			Entre as diversas sequências repetitivas de DNA testadas através de ND-FISH e FISH em esfregaços cromossómicos mitóticos de P. sylvestris de diferentes proveniências, apenas sete SSRs [(AC)10, (AG)10, (AG)12; (AAG)5; (AAC)5; (GATA)4; (GACA)5 e (GGAT)4]; a repetição telomérica (TTTAGGG)6 e a 45S rDNA hibridaram com sucesso. Os padrões de hibridação foram semelhantes entre diferentes proveniências. Apesar da inexistência de estudos citogenéticos ou ideograma anteriores baseados em SSRs para pinheiro-silvestre, construi-se o esboço de um ideograma com base na sequencia SSR (AG)10, que revelou o maior número de sinais de hibridação. Experiências FISH adicionais estão previstas para identificar inequivocamente todos os cromossomas individuais. Inesperadamente, a sonda telomérica revelou uma distribuição dispersa e intersticial nos cromossomas. A sonda 45S rDNA detetou 14 loci rDNA corroborando estudos anteriores desenvolvidos em P. sylvestris. Contrariamente aos dados moleculares, os marcadores citogenéticos não contribuíram para a resposta à hipótese inicial. Contudo, o presente estudo citogenético constituiu o primeiro esboço de um ideograma para P. sylvestris baseado em sondas SSR e na discriminação de populações nativas e/ou raças geográficas de pinheiro-silvestre por marcadores citogenéticos.
			Pinus sylvestris L. (Scots pine) is widely distributed across Eurasia, ranging from southern Iberian Peninsula to beyond the Arctic Circle. Portugal constitutes the rear-end limit of its distribution. The foreseen global climate changes may jeopardize the adaptation of forest ecosystems since the process of change is rather fast in contrast to the time frame of trees. Peripheral and rear-end populations have become relevant for conservation biologists. They constitute a reservoir of intra-specific genetic diversity and experienced different natural selection regimes relatively to central populations. ‘Serra do Gerês’ might constitute a refuge for P. sylvestris during the last glacial age and present populations, at some riparian areas, could be remnant nuclei of putative native populations.
			This work was developed under the scope of the FCT project “Scots pine in Portugal: the Southwest end or just the end” (PTDC/AGR-CFL/110988/2009). Its major goal was to verify if the Portuguese Scots pine populations of ‘Serra do Gerês’ are in fact native, based on simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers (Chapter II) and physical location of repetitive DNA sequences by nondenaturing fluorescence in situ hybridization (ND-FISH) and FISH (Chapter III).
			During the present research, cloroplastidial SSR (cpSSR) loci and four nuclear SSR (nSSR) loci were analyzed five on genomic DNA from 96 individuals belonging to two Scots pine populations of ‘Serra do Gerês’ - ‘Ribeira das Negras’ and ‘Biduissa’, and four foreign populations representative of this species distribution. Both nSSR and cpSSR loci revealed to be highly polymorphic. Bayesian analysis identified a relevant number of K=3 clusters. The admixture proportions of the Bayesian analysis and the Principal Coordinate Analyses differentiated the Portuguese populations from each other and from the remaining populations. The pool of the SSR data provided evidences that the Portuguese populations have different origins comparatively to the foreign ones, supporting their native origin.
			Among the several repetitive DNA sequences tested by ND-FISH and FISH experiments performed in mitotic chromosome spreads of P. sylvestris from different provenances, seven SSRs [(AC)10; (AG)10; (AG)12; (AAG)5; (AAC)5; (GATA)4; (GACA)5 and (GGAT)4], the telomeric (TTTAGGG)6 and the 45S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) probes successfully hybridized. The hybridization patterns were similar among different provenances. Although there are no previous cytogenetic studies or ideograms based on SSRs for P. sylvestris, was attempted the construction of an ideogram for the probe SSR (AG)10 which showed the highest number of hybridization signals. Additional FISH experiments are envisaged in order to identify unequivocally all individual chromosomes. Unexpectedly, the telomeric probe showed an interspersed distribution along the chromosomes. The 45S rDNA probe detected 14 rDNA loci corroborating previous studies developed in P. sylvestris. Conversely to the molecular data, the cytogenetic markers did not aid to answer the initial hypothesis. However, the present cytogenetic study constituted the first attempt of an ideogram construction for P. sylvestris based on SSRs and discrimination of native populations and/or geographic races of this species by cytogenetic markers.","110988","Open Access","0.5795","0.3264","13","Hibridação in situ flurescente","Hibridação in situ flurescente",NA,NA,NA,"",""

However, many questions remain about the biases inherent to this technology. Notably, sequence misalignments arising from paralogy may affect the development of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and the estimation of genetic diversity. We evaluated the impact of putative paralog loci on genetic diversity estimation during the development of SNPs from a RADseq dataset for the nonmodel tree species Robinia pseudoacacia L. We sequenced nine genotypes and analyzed the frequency of putative paralogous RAD loci as a function of both the depth of coverage and the mismatch threshold allowed between loci. Putative paralogy was detected in a very variable number of loci, from 1% to more than 20%, with the depth of coverage having a major influence on the result. Putative paralogy artificially increased the observed degree of polymorphism and resulting estimates of diversity. The choice of the depth of coverage also affected diversity estimation and SNP validation: A low threshold decreased the chances of detecting minor alleles while a high threshold increased allelic dropout. SNP validation was better for the low threshold (4?) than for the high threshold (18?) we tested. Using the strategy developed here, we were able to validate more than 80% of the SNPs tested by means of individual genotyping, resulting in a readily usable set of 330 SNPs, suitable for use in population genetics applications.","284181","Open Access","0.4136","0.1483","8","Data in silico, Dealing with paralogy, Detection and single","Data in silico, Dealing with paralogy, Detection and single","3","40","2","",""

We combine insights into detailed studies at high resolution with the actual status of the forest and a realistic estimate of the current management practices at large scale. Results show that the European forest system is very inert and that it takes a long time to influence the species distribution by replacing species after final felling. By 2070, on average about 36 % of the area expected to have decreased species suitability will have changed species following business as usual management. Alternative management, consisting of shorter rotations for those species and species planting based on expected trends, will have increased this species transition to 40 %. The simulated forward-looking alternative management leads to some reduction in increment, but does not influence the amount of wood removed from the forest. Northern Europe is projected to show the highest production increases under climate change and can also adapt faster to the new (proposed) species distribution. Southwest Europe is expected to face the greatest challenge by a combination of a predicted loss of production and a slow rate of management alteration under climate change.","244122","Open Access","-0.3559","-0.3893","6","Forest information, Forest landscape, Information scenario","Forest information, Forest landscape, Information scenario","4","77","18","",""

Former models dealing with competition and environmental heterogeneity did not account for the additive relationships among trees or for the full spatial covariance. This paper extends an individual-tree mixed model with direct additive genetic, genetic, and environmental competition effects, by incorporating a two-dimensional smoothing surface to account for complex patterns of environmental heterogeneity (competition + spatial model (CSM)). We illustrate the proposed model using simulated and real data from a loblolly pine progeny trial. The CSM was compared with three reduced individual-tree mixed models using a real dataset, while simulations comprised only CSM versus true-parameters comparisons. Dispersion parameters were estimated using Bayesian techniques via Gibbs sampling. Simulation results showed that the CSM yielded posterior mean estimates of variance components with slight or negligible biases in the studied scenarios, except for the permanent environment variance. The worst performance of the simulated CSM was under a scenario with weak competition effects and small-scale environmental heterogeneity. When analyzing real data, the CSM yielded a lower value of the deviance information criterion than the reduced models. Moreover, although correlations between predicted BVs calculated from CSM and from a standard model with block effects and direct genetic effects only were high, the ranking among the top 5 % ranked individuals showed differences which indicated that the two models will have quite different genotype selections for the next cycle of breeding.","284181","Open Access","-0.123","-0.0262","4","Account for competition, Adaptive response, Annual cycle","Account for competition, Adaptive response, Annual cycle","1","20","7","",""

Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data sets are increasingly recognized as outstanding data sources for high?fidelity mapping of carbon stocks at regional scales. We develop a tree?centric approach to carbon mapping, based on identifying individual tree crowns (ITCs) and species from airborne remote sensing data, from which individual tree carbon stocks are calculated. We identify ITCs from the laser scanning point cloud using a region?growing algorithm and identifying species from airborne hyperspectral data by machine learning. For each detected tree, we predict stem diameter from its height and crown?width estimate. From that point on, we use well?established approaches developed for field?based inventories: above?ground biomasses of trees are estimated using published allometries and summed within plots to estimate carbon density. We show this approach is highly reliable: tests in the Italian Alps demonstrated a close relationship between field? and ALS?based estimates of carbon stocks (r 2?=?0?98). Small trees are invisible from the air, and a correction factor is required to accommodate this effect. An advantage of the tree?centric approach over existing area?based methods is that it can produce maps at any scale and is fundamentally based on field?based inventory methods, making it intuitive and transparent. Airborne laser scanning, hyperspectral sensing and computational power are all advancing rapidly, making it increasingly feasible to use ITC approaches for effective mapping of forest carbon density also inside wider carbon mapping programs like REDD++.","NE/K016377/1","Open Access","0.1495","-0.0452","14","Above?ground biomass, Airborne laser scanning, Boreal conifer species","Above?ground biomass, Airborne laser scanning, Boreal conifer species","12","46","15","",""

These are mainly characterised as semi-natural, multi-functional forests. Only about 13 million ha are characterised as plantationsi, although an additional 47 million ha are regarded as planted forests (Forest Europe 2011). European forests are highly diverse due to centuries of management in countries with different cultural objectives. Often the current management is nature oriented and so forests may not be used primarily for wood production. Wood provides only a small part of the income for many of the 16 million private owners according to the Confédération Européenne des Propriétaires Forestiers (CEPF 2013). These circumstances, plus sluggish demand for wood brought about by the current economic crisis, have generated challenges for the forestry sector. Demand for wood is expected to increase with expansion of the green economy and an increased emphasis on the use of bioenergy. Methods: Three forest management scenarios (analysed with the EFISCEN model) were used to project supply in response to demand for wood from EU forests over the next 50 years. Results: Shortening of broadleaved forest rotation length and planting 50% of the felled area with fast-growing coniferous species could increase coniferous wood supply from 473 to 561 million m3 y-1. Demand could reach more than 1200 million m3 y-1 by 2065. Conclusions: Conversion of 50% of broadleaved forest in EU27 countries to coniferous forest is not likely to satisfy the increased demand for wood expected by 2065.","284181","Open Access","-0.5292","-0.3825","6","Forest information, Forest landscape, Information scenario","Forest information, Forest landscape, Information scenario","13","27","2","",""

Especially, desert dust storms can transport alien microorganisms over continental scales and can deposit them in sensitive sink habitats. In winter 2014, the largest ever recorded Saharan dust event in Italy was efficiently deposited on the Dolomite Alps and was sealed between dust-free snow. This provided us the unique opportunity to overcome difficulties in separating dust associated from ?domestic? microbes and thus, to determine with high precision microorganisms transported exclusively by desert dust. Results Our metagenomic analysis revealed that sandstorms can move not only fractions but rather large parts of entire microbial communities far away from their area of origin and that this microbiota contains several of the most stress-resistant organisms on Earth, including highly destructive fungal and bacterial pathogens. In particular, we provide first evidence that winter-occurring dust depositions can favor a rapid microbial contamination of sensitive sink habitats after snowmelt. Conclusions Airborne microbial depositions accompanying extreme meteorological events represent a realistic threat for ecosystem and public health. Therefore, monitoring the spread and persistence of storm-travelling alien microbes is a priority while considering future trajectories of climatic anomalies as well as anthropogenically driven changes in land use in the source regions.

In this study, near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy calibrations were developed for a large collection of solid heartwood increment core samples in order to predict the amount of the stilbene pinosylvin (PS), its monomethyl ether (PSM) and their sum (STB). The resulting models presented quite accurate predictions in an independent validation set with R2 v values ranging between 0.79 and 0.91. The accuracy of the models strongly depended on the chemical being calibrated, with the lowest accuracy for PS, intermediate accuracy for PSM and highest accuracy for STB. The effect of collecting one, two or more (up to five) spectra per sample on the calibration models was studied and it was found that averaging multiple spectra yielded better accuracy as it may account for the heterogeneity of wood along the increment core within and between rings. Several statistical pretreatments of the spectra were tested and an automatic selection of wavenumbers prior to calibration. Without the automatic selection of wavenumbers, a first derivative of normalised spectra yielded the best accuracies, whereas after the automatic selection of wavenumbers, no particular statistical pretreatment appeared to yield better results than any other. Finally, the automatic selection of wavenumbers slightly improved the accuracy of the models for all traits. These results demonstrate the potential of NIR spectroscopy as a high-throughput and non-destructive phenotyping technique in tree breeding for the improvement of decay resistance in heartwood timber.","284181","Closed Access","-0.3109","0.2576","9","Biotechnologies, Scots pine, Stilbene content","Biotechnologies, Scots pine, Stilbene content",NA,NA,"1","",""

The main goals of the present study were: i) to investigate/measure the epigenetic diversity of the poplar populations by determining their DNA methylation status; ii) to assess if and how methylation status influences population clustering; iii) to shed light on the changes that occur in the epigenome of ramets of the same poplar clone. To these purposes, 83 white poplar trees were sampled at different locations on the island of Sardinia. Methylation sensitive amplified polymorphism analysis was carried out on the genomic DNA extracted from leaves at the same juvenile stage. The study showed that the genetic biodiversity of poplars is quite limited but it is counterbalanced by epigenetic inter-population molecular variability. The comparison between MspI and HpaII DNA fragmentation profiles revealed that environmental conditions strongly influence hemi-methylation of the inner cytosine. The variable epigenetic status of Sardinian white poplars revealed a decreased number of population clusters. Landscape genetics analyses clearly demonstrated that ramets of the same clone were differentially methylated in relation to their geographic position. Therefore, our data support the notion that studies on plant biodiversity should no longer be restricted to genetic aspects, especially in the case of vegetatively propagated plant species.","284181","Open Access","0.6472","-0.0477","5","Alba l populations, Biodiversity conservation, Biodiversity management","Alba l populations, Biodiversity conservation, Biodiversity management","5","30","5","",""

These formulations are composed of copper (Cu) carbonate particles (CuCO3 center dot Cu(OH)(2)), with sizes ranging from 1 nm to 250 mu m, according to manufacturers. MC-treated SYP wood is protected against decay by solubilized Cu2+ ions and unreacted CuCO3 center dot Cu(OH)(2) particles that successively release Cu2+ ions (reservoir effect). The wood species used for the European wood decking market differ from the North American SYP. One of the most common species is Norway spruce wood, which is poorly treatable i.e. refractory due to the anatomical properties, like pore size and structure, and chemical composition, like pit membrane components or presence of wood extractives. Therefore, MC formulations may not suitable for refractory wood species common in the European market, despite their good performance in SYP. We evaluated the penetration effectiveness of MC azole (MCA) in easily treatable Scots pine and in refractory Norway spruce wood. We assessed the effectiveness against the Cu-tolerant wood-destroying fungus Rhodonia placenta. Our findings show that MCA cannot easily penetrate refractory wood species and could not confirm the presence of a reservoir effect.","284181","Open Access","-0.6764","-0.1765","10","Research article","Research article","3","5","1","",""

The total porosity and the porosity of different cell types, as well as cell wall thickness and maximum opening of tracheid lumens were evaluated. The wetting properties (swelling and capillary uptake) were related to these microstructural characteristics. The data show significant changes in the wood structure for furfurylated pine sapwood samples, including a change in tracheid shape and filling of tracheids by furan polymer. In contrast, no such changes were noted for the acetylated pine samples at the high resolution of 0.8 mu m. The XCT images obtained for the furfurylated maple samples demonstrated that all ray cells and some vessel elements were filled with furan polymer while the fibers largely remained unchanged. Furfurylation significantly decreased the total porosity of both the maple and pine samples. Furthermore, this was observed in both earlywood (EW) and latewood (LW) regions in the pine samples. In contrast, the total porosity of pine samples was hardly affected by acetylation. These findings are in line with wetting results demonstrating that furfurylation reduces both swelling and capillary uptake in contrast to acetylation which reduces mostly swelling. Furfurylation significantly increased the cell wall thickness of both the maple and pine samples, especially at higher levels of furfurylation.

Existing phenological models rarely address this clinal variation, so that adaptive responses of tree populations to changes in environmental conditions are not taken into account, e.g., in models on species distributions that use phenological sub-models. This omission of simulating adaptive response in tree models may over- or underestimate the effects of climate change on tree species distributions, as well as the impacts of climate change on tree growth and productivity. Here, we present an approach to model the adaptive response of traits to environmental change based on an integrated process-based eco-physiological and quantitative genetic model of adaptive traits. Thus, the parameter values of phenological traits are expressed in genetic terms (allele effects and—frequencies, number of loci) for individual trees. These individual trees thereby differ in their ability to acquire resources, grow and reproduce as described by the process-based model, leading to differential survival. Differential survival is thus the consequence of both differences in parameters values and their genetic composition. By simulating recombination and dispersal of pollen, the genetic composition of the offspring will differ from that of their parents. Over time, the distribution of both trait values and the frequency of the underlying alleles in the population change as a consequence of changes in environmental drivers leading to adaptation of trees to local environmental conditions. This approach is applied to an individual-tree growth model that includes a phenological model on the annual cycle of trees whose parameters are allowed to adapt. An example of the adaptive response of the onset of the growing season across Europe is presented.","284181","Open Access","0.1152","-0.2945","4","Account for competition, Adaptive response, Annual cycle","Account for competition, Adaptive response, Annual cycle","6","26","1","",""

Karst.] in southern Norway is supposed to be associated with climatic extremes. Our intention was to learn more about the processes related to top dieback and in particular about the plasticity of possible predisposing factors. We aimed at (i) developing proxies for P 50 based on anatomical data assessed by SilviScan technology and (ii) testing these proxies for their plasticity regarding climate, in order to (iii) analyze annual variations of hydraulic proxies of healthy looking trees and trees with top dieback upon their impact on tree survival. At two sites we selected 10 tree pairs, i.e., one healthy looking tree and one tree with visual signs of dieback such as dry tops, needle shortening and needle yellowing (n = 40 trees). Vulnerability to cavitation (P 50) of the main trunk was assessed in a selected sample set (n = 19) and we thereafter applied SilviScan technology to measure cell dimensions (lumen (b) and cell wall thickness (t)) in these specimen and in all 40 trees in tree rings formed between 1990 and 2010. In a first analysis step, we searched for anatomical proxies for P 50. The set of potential proxies included hydraulic lumen diameters and wall reinforcement parameters based on mean, radial, and tangential tracheid diameters. The conduit wall reinforcement based on tangential hydraulic lumen diameters ((t/b ht)2) was the best estimate for P 50. It was thus possible to relate climatic extremes to the potential vulnerability of single annual rings. Trees with top dieback had significantly lower (t/b ht)2 and wider tangential (hydraulic) lumen diameters some years before a period of water deficit (2005?2006). Radial (hydraulic) lumen diameters showed however no significant differences between both tree groups. (t/b ht)2 was influenced by annual climate variability; strongest correlations were found with precipitation in September of the previous growing season: high precipitation in previous September resulted in more vulnerable annual rings in the next season. The results are discussed with respect to an ?opportunistic behavior? and genetic predisposition to drought sensitivity.","284181","Open Access","0.3716","-0.3106","14","Above?ground biomass, Airborne laser scanning, Boreal conifer species","Above?ground biomass, Airborne laser scanning, Boreal conifer species","1","19","4","",""

Yet, none of the land-surface models used in Earth system models, and therefore none of today's predictions of future climate, accounts for the interactions between climate and forest management. We addressed this gap in modelling capability by developing and parametrising a version of the ORCHIDEE land-surface model to simulate the biogeochemical and biophysical effects of forest management. The most significant changes between the new branch called ORCHIDEE-CAN (SVN r2290) and the trunk version of ORCHIDEE (SVN r2243) are the allometric-based allocation of carbon to leaf, root, wood, fruit and reserve pools; the transmittance, absorbance and reflectance of radiation within the canopy; and the vertical discretisation of the energy budget calculations. In addition, conceptual changes were introduced towards a better process representation for the interaction of radiation with snow, the hydraulic architecture of plants, the representation of forest management and a numerical solution for the photosynthesis formalism of Farquhar, von Caemmerer and Berry. For consistency reasons, these changes were extensively linked throughout the code. Parametrisation was revisited after introducing 12 new parameter sets that represent specific tree species or genera rather than a group of often distantly related or even unrelated species, as is the case in widely used plant functional types. Performance of the new model was compared against the trunk and validated against independent spatially explicit data for basal area, tree height, canopy structure, gross primary production (GPP), albedo and evapotranspiration over Europe. For all tested variables,ORCHIDEE-CAN outperformed the trunk regarding its ability to reproduce large-scale spatial patterns as well as their inter-annual variability over Europe. Depending on the data stream, ORCHIDEE-CAN had a 67 to 92% chance to reproduce the spatial and temporal variability of the validation data.","242564","Open Access","-0.1914","-0.3366","6","Forest information, Forest landscape, Information scenario","Forest information, Forest landscape, Information scenario",NA,NA,"18","",""
