This PRNG is written as an open source code which is subject to regular changes. It was last analyzed in the work of Gutterman et al. in 2006 [GPR06] but since then no new analysis has been made available, while in the meantime several changes have been applied to the code, among others, to counter the attacks presented in [GPR06]. Our work describes the Linux PRNG of kernel versions 2.6.30.7 and upwards. We detail the PRNG architecture in the Linux system and provide its first accurate mathematical description and a precise analysis of the building blocks, including entropy estimation and extraction. Subsequently, we give a security analysis including the feasibility of cryptographic attacks and an empirical test of the entropy estimator. Finally, we underline some important changes to the previous versions and their consequences.","216676","Open Access","0.1551","-0.4698","11","[info] computer science [cs], Affine coordinates, Alred construction","[info] computer science [cs], Affine coordinates, Alred construction",NA,NA,NA,"",""

We begin by looking at the security notions for broadcast encryption found in the literature. Since there is no easy way to compare these existing notions, we propose a framework of security notions for which we establish relationships. We then show where existing notions ﬁt within this framework. Second, we present a black-box construction of a decentralized dynamic broadcast encryption scheme. This scheme does not rely on any trusted authorities, and new users can join at any time. It achieves the strongest security notion based on the security of its components and has an eﬃcient instantiation that is fully secure under the DDH assumption in the standard model. Finally, we give a black-box construction of a message-based traitor tracing scheme, which allows tracing not only based on pirate decoders but also based on watermarks contained in a message. Our scheme is the ﬁrst one to obtain the optimal ciphertext rate of 1 symptotically. We then show that at today's data rates, the scheme is already practical for standard choices of values.; Dans cette thèse, nous étudions les déﬁnitions et les constructions en boite noire avec des instantiations eﬃcaces pour la diﬀusion chiﬀrée et le traçage de traîtres. Nous commençons par examiner les notions de sécurité pour la diﬀusion chiﬀrée présentes dans la littérature. Comme il n'y a pas de moyen facile de les comparer, nous proposons un cadre général et établissons des relations. Nous montrons alors comment les notions existantes s'inscrivent dans ce cadre. Ensuite, nous présentons une construction en boite noire d'un système de diﬀusion chiﬀrée dynamique décentralisée. Ce système ne repose sur aucune autorité de conﬁance, et de nouveaux utilisateurs peuvent joindre à tout moment. Le système satisfait la notion de sécurité la plus forte sous des hypothèses de sécurité classiques de ses composantes. Il admet une instantiation eﬃcace qui est sûre sous la seule hypothèse DDH dans le modèle standard. Enﬁn, nous donnons une construction en boite noire d'un système de traçage de traîtres à base de messages, qui permet de tracer non seulement à partir des décodeurs pirates, mais aussi à partir des tatouages numériques contenus dans un message. Notre schéma est le premier à obtenir asymptotiquement le taux d'expansion optimal de 1. Nous montrons également que vus les débits de données actuels, le schéma est déjà pratique pour les choix de valeurs usuels.","216676","Open Access","-0.6213","-0.4039","11","[info] computer science [cs], Affine coordinates, Alred construction","[info] computer science [cs], Affine coordinates, Alred construction",NA,NA,NA,"",""

Short signatures and identity-based encryption became also practical thanks to these pairings. This thesis contains two parts. One part is about optimized pairing implementation on different elliptic curves according to the targeted protocol. Pairings are implemented on supersingular elliptic curves in large characteristic and on Barreto-Naehrig curves. The pairing library developed at Thales is used in a broadcast encryption scheme prototype. The prototype implements pairings over Barreto-Naehrig curves. Pairings over supersingular curves are much slower and have larger parameters. However these curves are interesting when implementing protocols which use composite-order elliptic curves (the group order is an RSA modulus). We implement two protocols that use pairings on composite-order groups and compare the benchmarks and the parameter size with their counterpart in a prime-order setting. The composite-order case is 30 up to 250 times much slower according to the considered step in the protocols: the efficiency difference in between the two cases is very important. A second part in this thesis is about two families of genus 2 curves. Their Jacobians are isogenous to the product of two elliptic curves over a small extension field. The properties of elliptic curves can be translated to the Jacobians thanks to this isogeny. Point counting is as easy as for elliptic curves in this case. We also construct two endomorphisms both on the Jacobians and the elliptic curves. These endomorphisms can be used for scalar multiplication improved with a four-dimensional Gallant-Lambert-Vanstone method.; Depuis 2000 les couplages sont devenus un très bon outil pour la conception de nouveaux protocoles cryptographiques. Les signatures courtes et le chiffrement basé sur l'identité sont devenus réalisables grâce aux couplages. Les travaux réalisés dans cette thèse comprennent deux aspects complémentaires. Une partie consiste en l'implémentation optimisée de couplages sur différentes courbes elliptiques, en fonction des protocoles visés. Une implémentation sur des courbes supersingulières en grande caractéristique et sur des courbes de Barreto-Naehrig est détaillée. La bibliothèque développée au Laboratoire Chiffre de Thales est utilisée avec des courbes de Barreto-Naehrig dans un protocole de diffusion chiffrée. La seconde application évalue la différence de temps de calcul pour des protocoles utilisant les couplages sur des courbes d'ordre composé (un large module RSA) et la traduction de ces protocoles qui utilise plusieurs couplages sur des courbes plus habituelles. Les résultats montrent une différence d'un facteur de 30 à 250 en fonction des étapes des protocoles, ce qui est très important. Une seconde partie porte sur deux familles de courbes de genre deux. Les jacobiennes de ces courbes sont isogènes au produit de deux courbes elliptiques sur une extension de corps de petit degré. Cette isogénie permet de transférer les propriétés des courbes elliptiques vers les jacobiennes. Le comptage de points est aisé et ne requiert qu'un comptage de points sur une des courbes elliptiques isogènes, plus quelques ajustements. On présente aussi la construction de deux endomorphismes à la fois sur les jacobiennes et sur les courbes elliptiques. Ces deux endomorphismes permettent des multiplications scalaires efficaces en suivant la méthode de Gallant, Lambert et Vanstone, ici en dimension quatre.","216676","Open Access","0.2558","-0.6765","11","[info] computer science [cs], Affine coordinates, Alred construction","[info] computer science [cs], Affine coordinates, Alred construction",NA,NA,NA,"",""

In this model, if the Private Key Generator (PKG) maliciously re-distributes users' decryption keys, it runs the risk of being caught and prosecuted. Goyal proposed two constructions: the first one is efficient but can only trace well-formed decryption keys to their source; the second one allows tracing obfuscated decryption boxes in a model (called weak black-box model) where cheating authorities have no decryption oracle. The latter scheme is unfortunately far less efficient in terms of decryption cost and ciphertext size. In this work, we propose a new construction that combines the efficiency of Goyal's first proposal with a very simple weak black-box tracing mechanism. Our scheme is described in the selective-ID model but readily extends to meet all security properties in the adaptive-ID sense, which is not known to be true for prior black-box schemes.","216676","Open Access","-0.4752","-0.4665","7","Black box accountable, Box accountable authority, Certificateless encryption","Black box accountable, Box accountable authority, Certificateless encryption",NA,NA,NA,"",""

Next, we show how to extend these results to the forward-security setting based on ideas from the Itkis-Reyzin forward-secure signature scheme. Unlike the original Itkis-Reyzin scheme, our construction can be instantiated under different decisional complexity assumptions and has a much tighter security reduction. Finally, we show that the tighter security reductions provided by our proof methodology can result in concrete efficiency gains in practice, both in the standard and forward-security setting, as long as the use of stronger security assumptions is deemed acceptable.

Informally, an IB-KEM is VRF suitable if it provides what we call unique decryption (i.e. given a ciphertext C produced with respect to an identity ID , all the secret keys corresponding to identity ID′ , decrypt to the same value, even if ID≠ID′ ) and it satisfies an additional property that we call pseudorandom decapsulation. In a nutshell, pseudorandom decapsulation means that if one decrypts a ciphertext C, produced with respect to an identity ID , using the decryption key corresponding to any other identity ID′ the resulting value looks random to a polynomially bounded observer. Interestingly, we show that most known IB-KEMs already achieve pseudorandom decapsulation. Our construction is of interest both from a theoretical and a practical perspective.

The problem is as follows: let $N_1 = p_1 q_1$ and $N_2 = p_2 q_2$ be two RSA moduli of same bit-size, where $q_1$, $q_2$ are $\alpha$-bit primes. We are given the implicit information that $p_1$ and $p_2$ share $t$ most significant bits. We present a novel and rigorous lattice-based method that leads to the factorization of $N_1$ and $N_2$ in polynomial time as soon as $t \geq 2 \alpha + 3$. Subsequently, we heuristically generalize the method to $k$ RSA moduli $N_i = p_i q_i$ where the $p_i$'s all share $t$ most significant bits (MSBs) and obtain an improved bound on $t$ that converges to $t \geq \alpha + 3.55$... as $k$ tends to infinity. We study also the case where the $k$ factors $p_i$'s share $t$ contiguous bits in the middle and find a bound that converges to $2\alpha + 3$ when $k$ tends to infinity. This paper extends the work of May and Ritzenhofen in [9], where similar results were obtained when the $p_i$'s share least significant bits (LSBs). In [15], Sarkar and Maitra describe an alternative but heuristic method for only two RSA moduli, when the $p_i$'s share LSBs and/or MSBs, or bits in the middle. In the case of shared MSBs or bits in the middle and two RSA moduli, they get better experimental results in some cases, but we use much lower (at least 23 times lower) lattice dimensions and so we obtain a great speedup (at least $10^3$ faster). Our results rely on the following surprisingly simple algebraic relation in which the shared MSBs of $p_1$ and $p_2$ cancel out: $q_1 N_2 - q_2 N_ 1 = q_1 q_2 (p_2 - p_1)$. This relation allows us to build a lattice whose shortest vector yields the factorization of the $N_i$'s.","216676","Open Access","0.5921","-0.4693","11","[info] computer science [cs], Affine coordinates, Alred construction","[info] computer science [cs], Affine coordinates, Alred construction","8",NA,NA,"",""

On the negative side, we define a symmetric Polly Cracker encryption scheme and prove that this scheme only achieves bounded CPA security. Furthermore, we show that a large class of algebraic transformations cannot convert this scheme to a fully secure Polly-Cracker-style scheme.

With embedded processors being at the very heart of such applications, it is desirable to address SCA attacks with countermeasures which “naturally” fit deployment in those processors. This paper describes our work in implementing one such protection concept in an ASIC prototype and our results from a practical evaluation of its security. We are able to demonstrate that the basic principle of limiting the “leaking” portion of the processor works rather well to reduce the side-channel leakage. From this result we can draw valuable conclusions for future embedded processor design. In order to minimize the remaining leakage, the security concept calls for the application of a secure logic style. We used two concrete secure logic styles (iMDPL and DWDDL) in order to demonstrate this increase in security. Unfortunately, neither of these logic styles seems to do a particularly good job as we were still able to attribute SCA leakage to the secure-logic part of the processor. If a better suited logic style can be employed we believe that the overall leakage of the processor can be further reduced. Thus we deem the evaluated security concept as a viable method for protecting embedded processors.","EP/H001689/1","Open Access","0.0536","-0.3198","11","[info] computer science [cs], Affine coordinates, Alred construction","[info] computer science [cs], Affine coordinates, Alred construction","3",NA,NA,"",""

We provide efficient generic random-oracle constructions for PCE based on any probabilistic or deterministic encryption scheme; we also give a practical construction in the standard model. As another application we show how PCE can be used to improve the efficiency in group signatures with verifier-local revocation (VLR) and backward unlinkability.

This part can be nicely reformulated as a purely algebraic problem consisting in finding solutions to a multivariate polynomial $f (x1 , . . . , xm ) = 0$ such that $x_1 , . . . , x_m$ all belong to some vector subspace of $F_2^n /F_2$ . Our main contribution is the identification of particular structures inherent to such polynomial systems and a dedicated method for tackling this problem. We solve it by means of Gröbner basis techniques and analyze its complexity using the multi-homogeneous structure of the equations. A direct consequence of our results is an index calculus algorithm solving ECDLP over any binary field $F_2^n$ in time $O(2^{ω t} )$, with $t ≈ n/2$ (provided that a certain heuristic assumption holds). This has to be compared with Diem's [14] index calculus based approach for solving ECDLP over Fqn which has complexity exp O(n log(n)1/2 ) for q = 2 and n a prime (but this holds without any heuristic assumption).

We study how much lattice sampling can be sped up using floating-point arithmetic. First, we show that a direct floating-point implementation of these algorithms does not give any asymptotic speedup: the floating-point precision needs to be greater than the security parameter, leading to an overall complexity $\softO(n^3)$ where $n$ is the lattice dimension. However, we introduce a laziness technique that can significantly speed up these algorithms. Namely, in certain cases such as NTRUsign lattices, laziness can decrease the complexity to $\softO(n^2)$ or even $\softO(n)$.

Inspired by the implicit oracle of May and Ritzenhofen presented in the context of RSA (PKC2009), we assume that the ephemeral keys share a certain amount of bits without knowing the value of the shared bits. This work also extends results of Leadbitter, Page and Smart (CHES2004) which use a very similar type of partial information leakage. By eliminating the shared blocks of bits between the ephemeral keys, we provide lattices of small dimension (e.g. equal to the number of signatures) and thus obtain an efficient attack. More precisely, by using the LLL algorithm, the complexity of the attack is polynomial. We show that this method can work when ephemeral keys share certain amount of MSBs and/or LSBs, as well as contiguous blocks of shared bits in the middle. Under the Gaussian heuristic assumption, theoretical bounds on the number of shared bits in function of the number of signed messages are proven. Experimental results show that we are often able to go a few bits beyond the theoretical bound. For instance, if only 2 shared LSBs on each ephemeral keys of 200 signed messages (with no knowledge about the secret key) then the attack reveals the secret key. The success rate of this attack is about 90% when only 1 LSB is shared on each ephemeral keys associated with about 400 signed messages.","216676","Open Access","0.2504","-0.2993","11","[info] computer science [cs], Affine coordinates, Alred construction","[info] computer science [cs], Affine coordinates, Alred construction","2","2","6","",""

In particular, we propose a class of IB-KEMs that we call VRF-suitable, and we propose a direct construction of VRFs from VRF-suitable IB-KEMs. Informally, an IB-KEM is VRF-suitable if it provides what we call unique decapsulation (i.e., given a ciphertext C produced with respect to an identity ID, all the secret keys corresponding to identity ID′, decapsulate to the same value, even if ID≠ID′), and it satisfies an additional property that we call pseudo-random decapsulation. In a nutshell, pseudo-random decapsulation means that if one decapsulates a ciphertext C, produced with respect to an identity ID, using the decryption key corresponding to any other identity ID′, the resulting value looks random to a polynomially bounded observer. Our construction is of interest both from a theoretical and a practical perspective. Indeed, apart from establishing a connection between two seemingly unrelated primitives, our methodology is direct in the sense that, in contrast to most previous constructions, it avoids the inefficient Goldreich-Levin hardcore bit transformation. As an additional contribution, we propose a new VRF-suitable IB-KEM based on the decisional ℓ-weak Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Inversion assumption. Interestingly, when applying our transformation to this scheme, we obtain a new VRF construction that is secure under the same assumption, and it efficiently supports a large input space.","216676","Open Access","-0.1109","-0.6015","14","Verifiable random functions, Based key encapsulation, Identity based key","Verifiable random functions, Based key encapsulation, Identity based key","9",NA,NA,"",""

We do so by proving that the underlying identification schemes used in these schemes are a particular case of the lossy identification notion recently introduced by Abdalla et al. at Eurocrypt 2012. Next, we show how to extend these results to the forward-security setting based on ideas from the Itkis-Reyzin forward-secure signature scheme. Unlike the original Itkis-Reyzin scheme, our construction can be instantiated under different decisional complexity assumptions and has a much tighter security reduction. Moreover, we also show that the tighter security reductions provided by our proof methodology can result in concrete efficiency gains in practice, both in the standard and forward-security setting, as long as the use of stronger security assumptions is deemed acceptable. Finally, we investigate the design of forward-secure signature schemes whose security reductions are fully tight.","216676","Open Access","-0.4423","-0.2469","9","Forward secure signature, Lossy identification, [info.info-cr] computer science [cs]/cryptography and security [cs.cr]","Forward secure signature, Lossy identification, [info.info-cr] computer science [cs]/cryptography and security [cs.cr]","0",NA,NA,"",""

This is particularly disturbing as DAA is one of the few complex cryptographic protocols resulting from recent theoretical advances actually deployed in real life. Moreover, standardization bodies are currently looking into designing the next generation of such protocols. Our first contribution is to identify issues in existing models for DAA and explain how these errors allow for proving security of insecure protocols. These issues are exhibited in all deployed and proposed DAA protocols (although they can often be easily fixed). Our second contribution is a new security model for a class of “pre-DAA scheme”, that is, DAA schemes where the computation on the user side takes place entirely on the trusted platform. Our model captures more accurately than any previous model the security properties demanded from DAA by the trusted computing group (TCG), the group that maintains the DAA standard. Extending the model from pre-DAA to full DAA is only a matter of refining the trust models on the parties involved. Finally, we present a generic construction of a DAA protocol from new building blocks tailored for anonymous attestation. Some of them are new variations on established ideas and may be of independent interest. We give instantiations for these building blocks that yield a DAA scheme more efficient than the one currently deployed, and as efficient as the one about to be standardized by the TCG which has no valid security proof.","267188","Open Access","-0.4724","-0.345","7","Black box accountable, Box accountable authority, Certificateless encryption","Black box accountable, Box accountable authority, Certificateless encryption","11","2","13","",""

Multi-HFE is a generalization of the well-known HFE schemes. The idea is to use a multivariate quadratic system - instead of a univariate polynomial in HFE - over an extension field as a private key. According to the authors, this should make the classical direct algebraic (message-recovery) attack proposed by Faugère and Joux on HFE no longer efficient against Multi-HFE. We consider here the hardness of the key-recovery in Multi-HFE and its variants, but also in HFE (both for odd and even characteristic). We first improve and generalize the basic key recovery proposed by Kipnis and Shamir on HFE. To do so, we express this attack as matrix/vector operations. In one hand, this permits to improve the basic Kipnis-Shamir (KS) attack on HFE. On the other hand, this allows to generalize the attack on Multi-HFE. Due to its structure, we prove that a Multi-HFE scheme has much more equivalent keys than a basic HFE. This induces a structural weakness which can be exploited to adapt the KS attack against classical modifiers of multivariate schemes such as minus and embedding. Along the way, we discovered that the KS attack as initially described cannot be applied against HFE in characteristic 2. We have then strongly revised KS in characteristic 2 to make it work. In all cases, the cost of our attacks is related to the complexity of solving MinRank. Thanks to recent complexity results on this problem, we prove that our attack is polynomial in the degree of the extension field for all possible practical settings used in HFE and Multi-HFE. This makes then Multi-HFE less secure than basic HFE for equally-sized keys. As a proof of concept, we have been able to practically break the most conservative proposed parameters of multi-HFE in few days (256 bits security broken in 9 days).","216676","Open Access","0.345","-0.1646","5","Aes asic, Asic cores, Channel collision","Aes asic, Asic cores, Channel collision","21",NA,NA,"",""

Experimentally, solving these systems with Gröbner bases algorithms seems to be easier than solving homogeneous systems of the same degree. Nevertheless, the reasons of this behaviour are not clear. In this paper, we focus on bilinear systems (i.e. bihomogeneous systems where all equations have bidegree $(1,1)$). Our goal is to provide a theoretical explanation of the aforementioned experimental behaviour and to propose new techniques to speed up the Gröbner basis computations by using the multihomogeneous structure of those systems. The contributions are theoretical and practical. First, we adapt the classical $F_5$ criterion to avoid reductions to zero which occur when the input is a set of bilinear polynomials. We also prove an explicit form of the Hilbert series of bihomogeneous ideals generated by generic bilinear polynomials and give a new upper bound on the degree of regularity of generic affine bilinear systems. We propose also a variant of the $F_5$ Algorithm dedicated to multihomogeneous systems which exploits a structural property of the Macaulay matrix which occurs on such inputs. Experimental results show that this variant requires less time and memory than the classical homogeneous $F_5$ Algorithm. Lastly, we investigate the complexity of computing a Gröbner basis for the grevlex ordering of a generic $0$-dimensional affine bilinear system over $k[x_1,\ldots, x_{n_x}, y_1,\ldots, y_{n_y}]$. In particular, we show that this complexity is upper bounded by $O\left({{n_x+n_y+\min(n_x+1,n_y+1)}\choose{\min(n_x+1,n_y+1)}}^\omega\right)$, which is polynomial in $n_x+n_y$ (i.e. the number of unknowns) when $\min(n_x,n_y)$ is constant.","216676","Open Access","0.4396","-0.3201","4","Bihomogeneous ideals, [info.info-cr] computer science [cs]/cryptography and security [cs.cr]","Bihomogeneous ideals, [info.info-cr] computer science [cs]/cryptography and security [cs.cr]","12",NA,NA,"",""

The most efficient known algorithms reduce the Gröbner basis computation to Gaussian eliminations on several matrices. However, several degrees of freedom are available to generate these matrices. It is well known that the particular strategies used can drastically affect the efficiency of the computations. In this work we investigate a recently-proposed strategy, the so-called \"Mutant strategy\", on which a new family of algorithms is based (MXL,obner basis MXL2 and MXL3 ). By studying and describing the algorithms based on Gröbner concepts, we demonstrate that the Mutant strategy can be understood to be equivalentto the classical Normal Selection strategy currently used in Gröbner basis algorithms. Furthermore, we show that the \"partial enlargement\" technique can be understood as a strategy for restricting the number of S-polynomials considered in an iteration of the F4 Gröbner basis algorithm, while the new termination criterion used in MXL3 does not lead to termination at a lower degree than the classical Gebauer-Möller installation of Buchberger's criteria. We claim that our results map all novel concepts from the MXL family of algorithms to their well-known Grö obner basis equivalents.

The concept has recently drawn renewed interest. Notably, Canetti and Hohenberger showed how to properly define (and realize) chosen-ciphertext security for the primitive. Their system is bidirectional as the translation key allows converting ciphertexts in both directions. This paper presents the first unidirectional proxy re-encryption schemes with chosen-ciphertext security in the standard model (i.e. without the random oracle idealization). The first system provably fits a unidirectional extension of the Canetti-Hohenberger security model. As a second contribution, the paper considers a more realistic adversarial model where attackers may choose dishonest users' keys on their own. It is shown how to modify the first scheme to achieve security in the latter scenario. At a moderate expense, the resulting system provides additional useful properties such as non-interactive temporary delegations. Both constructions are efficient and rely on mild complexity assumptions in bilinear groups. Like the Canetti-Hohenberger scheme, they meet a relaxed flavor of chosen-ciphertext security introduced by Canetti, Krawczyk and Nielsen.","216676","Open Access","-0.2475","-0.4264","7","Black box accountable, Box accountable authority, Certificateless encryption","Black box accountable, Box accountable authority, Certificateless encryption","47",NA,NA,"",""

Security flaws in DNS led to a major overhaul, with the introduction of the DNS Security Extensions. DNSSEC adds integrity and authenticity to the DNS using digital signatures. DNSSEC, however, has its own concerns. It suffers from availability problems due to packet fragmentation and is a potent source of distributed denial-of-service attacks. In earlier work we argued that many issues with DNSSEC stem from the choice of RSA as default signature algorithm. A switch to alternatives based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) can resolve these issues. Yet switching to ECC introduces a new problem: ECC signature validation is much slower than RSA validation. Thus, switching DNSSEC to ECC imposes a significant additional burden on DNS resolvers, pushing load toward the edges of the network. Therefore, in this paper we study the question: will switching DNSSEC to ECC lead to problems for DNS resolvers, or can they handle the extra load? To answer this question, we developed a model that accurately predicts how many signature validations DNS resolvers have to perform. This allows us to calculate the additional CPU load ECC imposes on a resolver. Using real-world measurements from four DNS resolvers and with two open source DNS implementations, we evaluate future scenarios where DNSSEC is universally deployed. Our results conclusively show that switching DNSSEC to ECC signature schemes does not impose an insurmountable load on DNS resolvers, even in worst-case scenarios.","216676","Open Access","-0.2323","0.3696","11","[info] computer science [cs], Affine coordinates, Alred construction","[info] computer science [cs], Affine coordinates, Alred construction","2","14","12","",""

Among others, PoSSo have applications in area such as coding theory and cryptology. Typically, the security of multivariate public-key schemes (MPKC) such as the UOV cryptosystem of Kipnis, Shamir and Patarin is directly related to the hardness of PoSSo over finite fields. The goal of this paper is to further understand the influence of finite fields on the hardness of PoSSo. To this end, we consider the so-called hybrid approach. This is a polynomial system solving method dedicated to finite fields proposed by Bettale, Faugère and Perret (Journal of Mathematical Cryptography, 2009). The idea is to combine exhaustive search with Gröbner bases. The efficiency of the hybrid approach is related to the choice of a trade-off between the two meth- ods. We propose here an improved complexity analysis dedicated to quadratic systems. Whilst the principle of the hybrid approach is simple, its careful analysis leads to rather surprising and somehow unexpected results. We prove that the optimal trade-off (i.e. num- ber of variables to be fixed) allowing to minimize the complexity is achieved by fixing a number of variables proportional to the number of variables of the system considered, denoted n. Under some nat- ural algebraic assumption, we show that the asymptotic complexity of the hybrid approach is 2^{n(3.31−3.62 log_2(q))} , where q is the size of the field (under the condition in particular that log(q) << n). This is to date, the best complexity for solving PoSSo over finite fields (when q > 2). We have been able to quantify the gain provided by the hybrid approach compared to a direct Gröbner basis method. For quadratic systems, we show (assuming a natural algebraic as- sumption) that this gain is exponential in the number of variables. Asymptotically, the gain is 2^{1.49 n} when both n and q grow to infinity and log(q) << n.","216676","Open Access","0.3058","-0.4119","4","Bihomogeneous ideals, [info.info-cr] computer science [cs]/cryptography and security [cs.cr]","Bihomogeneous ideals, [info.info-cr] computer science [cs]/cryptography and security [cs.cr]","5",NA,NA,"",""

While the RFID market is expected to grow, concerns about security and privacy of the RFID tag should be overcome for the future use. To overcome these issues, privacy-preserving authentication protocols based on cryptographic algorithms have been designed. However, to the best of our knowledge, evaluation of the whole tag, which includes an antenna, an analog front end, and a digital processing block, that runs authentication protocols has not been studied. In this paper, we present an implementation and evaluation of a fully integrated passive UHF RFID tag that runs a privacy-preserving mutual authentication protocol based on a hash function. We design a single chip including the analog front end and the digital processing block. We select a lightweight hash function supporting 80-bit security strength and a standard hash function supporting 128-bit security strength. We show that when the lightweight hash function is used, the tag completes the protocol with a reader-tag distance of 10 cm. Similarly, when the standard hash function is used, the tag completes the protocol with the distance of 8.5 cm. 
			We discuss the impact of the peak power consumption of the tag on the distance of the tag due to the hash function.","216676","Open Access","-0.0907","0.2851","1","Authentication protocols, Mutual authentication protocol, Rfid authentication","Authentication protocols, Mutual authentication protocol, Rfid authentication","1",NA,NA,"",""

This technology is expected to serve as a foundation for a set of novel safety, automation, and infotainment applications. The most prominent among these appli- cations are expected to be driver assistance systems which also support advanced levels of automated driving. These applications stand to benefit from enhanced situational awareness, which is made possible through the cooperative exchange of information about environmental influences and the presence and condition of surrounding vehicles. Wireless networking technology and networking in general are well understood domains in computer science. However, the context of con- nected vehicles and the associated requirements and communication patterns imposes a set of unique challenges, which require solutions that differ from established networking practices. The susceptibility of wireless communication to packet loss and the very high mobility of vehicular communication nodes make VANET technology extremely volatile. At the same time the usage in safety critical applications de- mands very low latency and high availability of the communication infrastructure for frequent information exchange. And on top of these challenges security and privacy need taken into account in the design of the overall communication infrastructure. Classic solutions for stable networks cannot provide optimal performance characteristics under these conditions. The focus of this work is specifically on vehicle-to-vehicle technology (V2V), which is a subset of the more general vehicle-to-anything (V2X) topic. This subset of VANET is concerned with the direct informa- tion exchange among vehicles without the involvement of additional infrastructure, which may or may not be available to vehicles which driving. Direct V2V communication is expected to always be available between vehicle within a safety critical range. Therefore, this commu- nication path is expected to be used to enable the most safety critical applications. The scalability of security solutions for vehicular communication remains an untested aspect of ongoing efforts to bring VANET technol- ogy to the market on a larger scale. Filed operational test projects have started to trial VANET deployments to investigate, but penetration rates are too low to allow for realistic extrapolations of future scala- bility problems. This dissertations contributes to the research efforts that support the development of secure vehicular communication technology through investigations of attributes and solutions for scalable security for V2V broadcast communication. Part II reviews security requirements and provides detailed quan- tifications of performance requirements for security in V2V broadcast communication. These requirements define the solution space for ap- plicable broadcast authentication techniques. Additionally, the review of achievable security and privacy goals enables informed trade-offs between security and privacy in the context of effective and efficient pseudonymity schemes. Finally, an information flow analysis shows the broader need to consider attacker models beyond the classic net- work oriented view, in order to capture the full spectrum of the threat landscape for connected vehicle technology. Part III contributes a study of hardware assisted scalability solutions for the relevant cryptographic algorithms in V2V broadcast authen- tication. This specifically concerns the performance characteristics of dedicated hardware security modules and the feasibility of reaching sufficient performance levels to satisfy the requirements of the expected communication patterns in vehicular environments. A second contri- bution under the topic of hardware assisted scalability solutions is a novel storage systems for pseudonymous identities. An application of Physically Inclinable Functions (PUF) allows for very efficient and secure storage of large sets of private key material, as it is expected to be used for privacy protection on vehicular communication. Part IV contributes detailed simulation studies of the costs and benefits of in-line certificate management in the V2V communication channel with a focus on scalability. The increased communication load due to the inclusion of certificate material can cause availability prob- lems in highly congested situations. Proposals for certificate omission schemes exist, but do not sufficiently take scalability in extremely con- gested situations into account. A novel congestion-based certificate omission scheme is proposed and evaluated in simulation studies. Ad- ditionally, a novel certificate pre-distribution approach is proposed, which is permissible under the assumptions of achievable privacy and can offer enhanced availability during privacy preserving pseudonym changes.","216676","Open Access","-0.0429","-0.1612","11","[info] computer science [cs], Affine coordinates, Alred construction","[info] computer science [cs], Affine coordinates, Alred construction","",NA,NA,"",""

This may cause WSN users, who totally trust these security mechanisms, to think that a sensor reading is secure, even when an adversary has corrupted it. For that reason, a scheme capable of estimating the security level (SL) that these mechanisms provide to sensor data is needed, so that users can be aware of the actual security state of this data and can make better decisions on its use. However, existing security estimation schemes proposed for WSNs fully ignore detection mechanisms and analyze solely the security provided by prevention mechanisms. In this context, this work presents the sensor data security estimator (SDSE), a new comprehensive security estimation scheme for WSNs. SDSE is designed for estimating the sensor data security level based on security metrics that analyze both attack prevention and detection mechanisms.
