However, OER lie at the heart of the Open Education movement, which advocates that communities and individuals should have access not only to repositories, but also to open technologies and methodologies. Since 2006, innovative OER initiatives such as OpenLearn (McAndrew et al., 2009) have been providing both open content and knowledge media environments (e.g. LabSpace by OpenLearn) for users to create their own open resources, courses and practices. Currently, it is possible to observe that an increasing number of open learning projects has been moving beyond the provision of repositories to offer social personalised platforms for collaborative open knowledge construction. These initiatives (e.g. OpenScout, 2010; weSPOT, 2013) offer opportunities for users to organise their social networks and co-create resources, courses, methodologies, inquiries and best practices.\ud \ud The aim of this paper is to discuss the potential of online collaborative learning to support the development of 21st century skills. It draws upon an on-going virtual ethnography that aims to investigate colearning – collaborative open learning – with Open Educational Resources (OER) and social networks. The research focuses on COLEARN, an open research network constituted by communities of educators, students and researchers who have been participating in various OER projects, including OpenLearn (2006-2009) (Lane, 2012), OpenScout (2010-2012) (Okada, 2014) and weSPOT(2013-2015) (Mikroyannidis et al., 2012).

Amongst the activities develop ed, 7 open web conferences were organised with research groups responsible for each chapter, who discussed their work with readers on Facebook and FM webconference application. COLEARN’s fieldwork includes both quantitative and qualitative sources.

The current work outlines the pedagogical and diagnostic frameworks for scientific inquiry. The pedagogical framework is aimed at supporting informal, self-regulated learning settings as well as the embedding in a formal learning context. The scientific exploration process can take place independently, or in collaboration with others. The diagnostic framework focuses on the pedagogical diagnosis, which will be tailored to the ambitious aim of inferring students' inquiry and meta-cognitive skills as well as domain-specific knowledge from observational data tracked within the weSPOT environment. Pilot studies planned to be conducted in 16 test-beds across 6 EU countries will test the reference model and make use of the diagnostic instrument.

			A discussão da coaprendizagem na Educação 3.0 é contextualizada no âmbito da sociedade em rede, onde a aprendizagem formal e informal são imprescindíveis no desenvolvimento e exercício de competências sociais, culturais, cognitivas, tecnológicas tanto para o domínio e fluência profissional como no exercício da cidadania. O principal objetivo desta reflexão é: compreender os estilos de coaprendizagem com base na teoria dos estilos de aprendizagem destacando conexões com a Educação 3.0 nas práticas 
			de aprendizagem abertas. Realizamos uma análise descritiva suportada por referenciais bibliográficos, reflexões e discussões do espaço de diálogo da Comunidade COLEARN em projetos europeus que integra várias instituições coordenadas pela Open University UK. Os resultados trazem indicadores–chave para analisaros estilos de coaprendizagem no contexto da Educação 3.0.

			learning styles by highlighting connections with Education 3.0 through open learning practices. The descriptive analysis was developed grounded on the literature as well as on the reflections and discussions of the participants of the COLEARN Community in European projects that integrates several

Although CLEs bring significant benefits to educators and learners, there is still little evidence of CLEs being actively and effectively used in the teaching and learning process. This chapter addresses this issue by introducing a European initiative called weSPOT (Working Environment with Social, Personal and Open Technologies for Inquiry-based Learning) for supporting and enhancing inquiry-based learning in STEM education via a cloud-based inquiry toolkit. The chapter presents evidence of using this toolkit within a case study that investigates how a secondary education community of students / co-learners selects information sources on the web and identifies factors associated with the reliability of information sources during their collaborative inquiry (co-inquiry) project in online environments.","318499","Open Access","0.2354","-0.1113","4","Learning environments, Environments ples, Role project","Learning environments, Environments ples, Role project","0",NA,NA,"",""

The method applied was cyber-ethnography with asynchronous observation (forum and wiki) and synchronous discussions (webconference) for analysing skills developed by a co-learning community. This study focuses on participants from different countries who interacted during nine months in two open platforms: the massive educational portal EDUCARED<em> </em>of the “7<sup>th </sup>International Conference on Education 2012-2013\" and weSPOT, an European “Working Environment with Social Personal and Open Technologies for inquiry based learning”. As a result of this study, it was observed that the EDUCARED portal led to the development of more explicit digital literacies, possibly because it was a simpler and familiar interface (forum). And in the weSPOT environment, experienced participants with digital technologies had more opportunities to develop other skills related to Critical-Creative Thinking and Scientific Reasoning.</p>","318499","Open Access","-0.3616","-0.1872","7","Coaprendizagem e coinvestigação, Competências chave, Digital para coaprendizagem","Coaprendizagem e coinvestigação, Competências chave, Digital para coaprendizagem","1",NA,NA,"",""
