This has translated into the development of a large number of structurally diverse catalysts. Whereas most of these investigations are focused on determining catalytic performance, only rare examples of studies dealing with chemoselectivity have been reported to date. Usually, variations are observed in product conversions but rarely in product distributions. In this critical review, we provide an overview of the stereochemistry of newly formed CQC bonds either in ring-closing or cross-metathesis as a function of the catalyst structure. A discussion of disparities encountered in macrocyclisation reactions leading (or not) to the formation of dimeric products is also presented. Since distinctive metathesis products could be isolated as a function of the ligand borne by the ruthenium centre—phosphine or N-heterocyclic carbene in the dissymetrization of trienes, enyne metathesis and ring rearrangements, these topics are also discussed (72 references).","211468","Open Access","-0.0905","-0.0288","10","Catalyzed olefin metathesis, Ruthenium catalyzed olefin, Accelerating influence","Catalyzed olefin metathesis, Ruthenium catalyzed olefin, Accelerating influence",145,NA,NA,"",""

The calculated Ru-halide bond energies span the rather broad window of 25-43 kcal mol(-1). This indicates that in many systems dissociation of the Ru-halide bond is possible and is actually competitive with dissociation of the labile ligand generating the 14e active species.
