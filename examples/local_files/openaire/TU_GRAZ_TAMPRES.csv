These devices are usually very resource constrained but at the same time likely to operate in a hostile environment. Thus, the implementation of low-cost protection mechanisms against physical attacks is vital for their market relevance. An appealing choice, to counteract a large family of physical attacks with one mechanism, seem to be protocol-level countermeasures. At last yearâ€™s Africacrypt, a fresh re-keying scheme has been presented which combines the advantages of re-keying with those of classical countermeasures such as masking and hiding. The contribution of this paper is threefold: most importantly, the original fresh re-keying scheme was limited to one low-cost party (e.g. an RFID tag) in a two party communication scenario. In this paper we extend the scheme to n low-cost parties and show that the scheme is still secure. Second, one unanswered question in the original paper was the susceptibility of the scheme to algebraic SPA attacks. Therefore, we analyze this property of the scheme. Finally, we implemented the scheme on a common 8-bit microcontroller to show its efficiency in software.","258754","Open Access","-0.5447","0.3237","1","[info] computer science [cs]","[info] computer science [cs]",6,"6",NA,"",""

When integrating security to RFID tags, not only the cryptographic algorithms need to be secure but also their implementation. In this work we present differential power analysis (DPA) and differential electromagnetic analysis (DEMA) attacks on a security-enabled RFID tag. The attacks are conducted on both an ASIC-chip version and on an FPGA-prototype version of the tag. The design of the ASIC version equals that of commercial RFID tags and has analog and digital part integrated on a single chip. Target of the attacks is an implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with 128-bit key length and DPA countermeasures. The countermeasures are shuffling of operations and insertion of dummy rounds. Our results illustrate that the effort for successfully attacking the ASIC chip in a real-world scenario is only 4.5 times higher than for the FPGA prototype in a laboratory environment. This let us come to the conclusion that the effort for attacking contactless devices like RFID tags is only slightly higher than that for contact-based devices. The results further underline that the design of countermeasures like the insertion of dummy rounds has to be done with great care, since the detection of patterns in power or electromagnetic traces can be used to significantly lower the attacking effort.","258754","Open Access","-0.4972","-0.2908","2","Side-channel analysis sca","Side-channel analysis sca",3,"11","1","",""

However, the lack of comparative source codes generally makes it hard to evaluate the extent to which different ciphers actually reach their low-cost goals, on different platforms. This paper reports on an initiative aimed to partially relax this issue. First, we implemented 12 block ciphers on an ATMEL ATtiny45 device, and made the corresponding source code available on a webpage, with an open-source license. Common design goals and interface have been sent to all designers in order to enhance the comparability of the implementation results. Second, we evaluated the performances of these implementations according to different metrics, including energy-consumption measurements. Although inherently limited by slightly different design choices, we hope this initiative can trigger more work in this direction, e.g. by extending the list of implemented ciphers, or adding countermeasures against physical attacks in the future.","258754","Open Access","-0.1998","0.5129","8","Block ciphers","Block ciphers",16,NA,NA,"",""

In practice, pseudorandom functions are among the most important such primitives, because they are stateless and do not require a secure initialization as, e.g. stream ciphers. However, their deployment in actual applications is still limited by security and efficiency concerns. This paper contributes to solve these issues in two directions. On the one hand, we highlight that the condition of bounded data complexity, that is guaranteed by previous leakage-resilient constructions, may not be enough to obtain practical security. We show experimentally that, if implemented in an 8-bit microcontroller, such constructions can actually be broken. On the other hand, we present tweaks for tree-based leakage-resilient PRFs that improve their efficiency and their security, by taking advantage of parallel implementations. Our security analyses are based on worst-case attacks in a noise-free setting and suggest that under reasonable assumptions, the side-channel resistance of our construction grows super-exponentially with a security parameter that corresponds to the degree of parallelism of the implementation. In addition, it exhibits that standard DPA attacks are not the most relevant tool for evaluating such leakage-resilient constructions and may lead to overestimated security. As a consequence, we investigate more sophisticated tools based on lattice reduction, which turn out to be powerful in the physical cryptanalysis of these primitives. Eventually, we put forward that the AES is not perfectly suited for integration in a leakage-resilient design. This observation raises interesting challenges for developing block ciphers with better properties regarding leakage-resilience.","258754","Open Access","-0.3108","0.0982","14","Leakage resilient, Security","Leakage resilient, Security",10,NA,NA,"",""

Their goal is to compress a high-entropy source into a more uniform out-put. Beyond their theoretical interest, they have recently gained attention because of their use in the design and proof of leakage-resilient primitives, such as stream ciphers and pseudorandom functions. However, for
			these proofs of leakage resilience to be meaningful in practice, it is important to instantiate and implement the components they are based on.
			In this context, while numerous works have investigated the implementation properties of block ciphers such as the AES Rijndael, very little is known about the application of side-channel attacks against extractor implementations. In order to close this gap, this paper instantiates a low-cost hardware extractor and analyzes it both from a performance
			and from a side-channel security point of view. Our investigations lead to contrasted conclusions. On the one hand, extractors can be efficiently implemented and protected with masking. On the other hand, they provide adversaries with many more exploitable leakage samples than, e.g. block ciphers. As a result, they can ensure high security margins against standard (non-profiled) side-channel attacks and turn out to be much weaker against profiled attacks. From a methodological point of view, our analysis consequently raises the question of which attack strategies should be considered in security evaluations.","258754","Open Access","-0.1713","-0.1202","5","Attacks weak, Data codingandinformationtheory, Extractors side","Attacks weak, Data codingandinformationtheory, Extractors side",3,NA,NA,"",""
