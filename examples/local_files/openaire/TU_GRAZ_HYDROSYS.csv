R.","2010-01-01","AMER CHEMICAL SOC","publication","","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY","","Elevated in-stream temperature has led to a surge in the occurrence of parasitic intrusion proliferative kidney disease and has resulted in fish kills throughout Switzerland's waterways. Data from distributed temperature sensing (DTS) in-stream measurements for three cloud-free days in August 2007 over a 1260 m stretch of the Boiron de Morges River in southwest Switzerland were used to calibrate and validate a physically based one-dimensional stream temperature model. Stream temperature response to three distinct riparian conditions were then modeled: open, in-stream reeds, and forest cover. Simulation predicted a mean peak stream temperature increase of 0.7 degrees C if current vegetation was removed, an increase of 0.1 degrees C if dense reeds covered the entire stream reach, and a decrease of 1.2 degrees C if a mature riparian forest covered the entire reach. Understanding that full vegetation canopy cover is the optimal riparian management option for limiting stream temperature, in-stream reeds, which require no riparian set-aside and grow very quickly, appear to provide substantial thermal control, potentially useful for land-use management.","224416","Open Access","-0.6921","-0.1483","15","Nccr-mics/esdm","Nccr-mics/esdm",22,NA,NA,"",""

Effective metadata management plays a crucial role in processing and properly interpreting raw sensor measurement data, and needs to be performed in a collaborative fashion. Previous work on metadata management for experimental and measurement data has not provided specific support for joint real-time processing of metadata and sensor data. In this paper we propose a framework that allows effective sensor metadata management based on realtime metadata creation and processing over federated sensor networks. The framework is based on three key mechanisms: (i) Distributed metadata joins to allow streaming sensor data to be efficiently processed with associated metadata, regardless of their location in the network. (ii) Automated metadata generation to permit users to define monitoring conditions or operations for extracting and storing metadata from streaming sensor data. (iii) Advanced metadata search utilizing various techniques specifically designed for sensor metadata querying and visualization. The framework is currently deployed and used as the backbone of a concrete application in environmental science and engineering, the Swiss Experiment, which runs a wide variety of measurements and experiments for environmental hazard forecasting and warning.","224416","Open Access","-0.1074","-0.2235","3","Sensor metadata","Sensor metadata",8,NA,NA,"",""

As proved by a game-theoretical model, no    migrations or replications occur in the system at    equilibrium, which is soon reached when the query load and    the used storage are stable. Moreover, by means of extensive    simulation experiments, we have proved that our approach    dynamically finds the optimal resource allocation that    balances the query processing overhead and satisfies the    availability objectives in a cost-efficient way for    different query rates and storage requirements.

The aim of this study was to investigate snow deposition and wind-induced snow-transport processes on different scales and to analyze some major drift events caused by north-west storms during two consecutive accumulation periods. In particular, we distinguish between the individual processes that cause specific drifts using a physically based model approach. Very high resolution wind fields (5 m) were computed with the atmospheric model Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) and used as input for a model of snow-surface processes (Alpine3D) to calculate saltation, suspension and preferential deposition of precipitation. Several flow features during north-west storms were identified with input from a high-density network of permanent and mobile weather stations and indirect estimations of wind directions from snow-surface structures, such as snow dunes and sastrugis. We also used Terrestrial and Airborne Laser Scanning measurements to investigate snow-deposition patterns and to validate the model. The model results suggest that the in-slope deposition patterns, particularly two huge cross-slope cornice-like drifts, developed only when the prevailing wind direction was northwesterly and were formed mainly due to snow redistribution processes (saltation-driven). In contrast, more homogeneous deposition patterns on a ridge scale were formed during the same periods mainly due to preferential deposition of precipitation. The numerical analysis showed that snow-transport processes were sensitive to the changing topography due to the smoothing effect of the snow cover.
