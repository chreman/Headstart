Herein, towards the goal of developing a safe and more efficacious high field T 1 MRI CA for these applications, we report the sub-acute toxicity and contrast enhancing capabilities of a novel nanoparticle MRI CA comprising of manganese (Mn2+) intercalated graphene nanoparticles functionalized with dextran (hereafter, Mangradex) in rodents. Sub-acute toxicology performed on rats intravenously injected with Mangradex at 1, 50 or 100?mg/kg dosages 3 times per week for three weeks indicated that dosages ?50?mg/kg could serve as potential diagnostic doses. Whole body 7 Tesla MRI performed on mice injected with Mangradex at a potential diagnostic dose (25?mg/kg or 455 nanomoles Mn2+/kg; ~2 orders of magnitude lower than the paramagnetic ion concentration in a typical clinical dose) showed persistent (up to at least 2?hours) contrast enhancement in the vascular branches (Mn2+ concentration in blood at steady state?=?300 ppb, per voxel?=?45 femtomoles). The results lay the foundations for further development of Mangradex as a vascular and cellular/ molecular MRI probe.","1P41EB017183-01A1","Open Access","0.4899","0.4764","6","Article","Article","2","7",10,"",""

In the context of advanced technologies, Dynamic Voltage-Frequency Scaling (DVFS) techniques are widely proposed to improve e ciency. Nowadays, these mechanisms are composed of independent actuators controlling the applied voltage and clock frequency. A prede ned sequence has to be used to switch from one state to another in order to avoid timing faults but increasing the energy cost. The timing of the sequence depends on the dynamic response of actuators. In this work, an external controller is designed in order to couple both actuators to manage the voltage and frequency transient periods, increasing power e ciency The proposed controller has been implemented to couple a Vdd-hopping mechanism with a Frequency-Lock Loop circuit.","100205","Open Access","-0.071","-0.4441","3","System stability","System stability",NA,NA,1,"",""

However, the area overhead of adding voltage and frequency control engines in each voltage and frequency island must be taken into account to optimize the circuit. A small-area fast-reprogrammable Frequency-Locked Loop (FLL) engine is a suited option, since its implementation in 32nm represents 0.0016mm 2, being 4 to 20 times smaller than classical techniques used such as a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) in the same technology. Another relevant aspect with respect to the FLL is the control design, which must be suited for low area hardware. In this paper, an analytical model of the system is deduced from accurate Spice simulations. It also takes into account the delay introduced by the sensor. From this model, an optimal and robust control law with a minimum implementation area is developed.

Since they have limited energy resources, power consumption has to be minimized. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) techniques combined with Body Biasing techniques decrease the power consumption of a chip by providing just enough computational performance to the chip so as to finish the task at its deadline. A Power Mode (PM) is defined with the clock frequency F applied to the chip and the power P consumed by the chip. Executing tasks with the 2 neighbor frequencies of the target frequency should minimize the power consumption. Unfortunately, this choice is not always optimal since the set of available PMs may not fulfil the convexity property anymore when 3 actuators are considered. Here, a method is proposed to tackle this issue. PMs are selected to form a discretely convex subset. Results for a ring oscillator in FD-SOI exemplify that the proposed approach can save power consumption.","332987","Open Access","-0.446","-0.3506","5","Clocks","Clocks",NA,NA,1,"",""

The DFLL control is designed so that the closed-loop system is able to cope with process variability while it rejects temperature changes and supply voltage slow variations. Therefore the DFLL is made of three main blocks, namely a Digitally Controlled Oscillator (DCO), a \"sensor\" that measures the frequency of the signal at the output of the DCO and a controller. A strong emphasis is set on the loop filter architecture choice and the tuning of its parameters. An analytical model of the DCO is deduced from accurate Spice simulations. The delay introduced by the sensor is also taken into account to design. From these models, an optimal and robust controller with a minimum implementation area is developed. Here, \"optimal\" means that the controller is computed via the minimization of a given criterion while the \"robustness\" capability ensures that the closed-loop system is tolerant to process and temperature variations in a given range. Therefore, performances of the closed-loop system are ensured whatever the system characteristics are in a given range.","100205","Open Access","0.3971","-0.2102","1","Architecture and control, Small area fll, Asynchronous locally synchronous","Architecture and control, Small area fll, Asynchronous locally synchronous",NA,NA,8,"",""

Like other conserved functional genes, LSGs play important roles in biological evolution and functions. Results Two set of citrus LSGs, 296 citrus-specific genes (CSGs) and 1039 orphan genes specific to sweet orange, were identified by comparative analysis between the sweet orange genome sequences and 41 genomes and 273 transcriptomes. With the two sets of genes, gene structure and gene expression pattern were investigated. On average, both the CSGs and orphan genes have fewer exons, shorter gene length and higher GC content when compared with those evolutionarily conserved genes (ECs). Expression profiling indicated that most of the LSGs expressed in various tissues of sweet orange and some of them exhibited distinct temporal and spatial expression patterns. Particularly, the orphan genes were preferentially expressed in callus, which is an important pluripotent tissue of citrus. Besides, part of the CSGs and orphan genes expressed responsive to abiotic stress, indicating their potential functions during interaction with environment. Conclusion This study identified and characterized two sets of LSGs in citrus, dissected their sequence features and expression patterns, and provided valuable clues for future functional analysis of the LSGs in sweet orange.
