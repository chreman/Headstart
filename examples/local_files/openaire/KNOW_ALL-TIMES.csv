Many of these software systems are time-critical. Hence, computations performed need not only to be correct, but must also be issued in a timely fashion. Worst case execution time (WCET) analysis is concerned with computing tight upper bounds for the execution time of a system in order to provide formal guarantees for the proper timing behaviour of a system. Central for this is to compute safe and tight bounds for loops and recursion depths. In this paper, we highlight the TuBound approach to this challenge at whose heart is a constraint logic based approach for loop analysis.","","-0.4058","0.306","11","Computer science - programming languages","Computer science - programming languages","",""
