The people that enter professional organizations today are part of a gamer generation that have some or much experience with on-line games. Therefore they are more open to e-learning and in general more open to access anything on-line. At the same time industrial organizations experience a pressure on their ability to train employees faster due to the increase in complexity. We argue that games are not yet mature enough to support this training challenge as stand alone efforts. But games can support the training and competence development in a synchronized setup with other means.","231717","Open Access","-0.1162","-0.1974","10","Experience, Industrial organizations, Line","Experience, Industrial organizations, Line",NA,NA,NA,"",""

We have analysed 400 anonymous written reflections and conducted 10 interviews in order to get a deeper insight of the game experience. This is an opportunistic investigation and the authors did not have control over the game environment. We have found that there is a predominantly positive attitude towards the approach taken by the game, and a significantly higher level of contributions from participants, as compared to a recent investigation of contributions in social awareness streams. A number of user contributions that clearly do not match the game intentions are being reported and discussed. We draw the conclusion that persuasive tools and techniques can be employed within personal learning environments in order to guide learning. The paper makes a strong argument by example for the use of browser games as a persuasive tool in informal online learning.","231717","Open Access","-0.0047","-0.5483","12","Computingmilieux personalcomputing","Computingmilieux personalcomputing",NA,NA,NA,"",""

The training of current and future engineers needs to achieve two criteria: the learners need to be able to apply the learning into complex, life-like situations and the learning outcomes need to be achieved rapidly. Competence-based and technology-enhanced learning (TEL) in general and serious games and simulations in particular have recently attracted a great deal of attention as they have the potential to deliver on both accounts. Designing learning content for simulation style competence-based TEL environments places special demands on competence modelling. Competences are traditionally defined and modelled using internal-to-individual factors such as knowledge, skills and attitudes. However, designing simulation style competence-based TEL environments, such as serious games, cannot be based solely on these factors. In work situations competences are performed neither in solitude nor isolation. Contextual factors such as organization processes, laws and norms, the market and available technologies significantly influence competence performance. As the simulations in question need to be life-like constructions ofwork situations the role of contextual factors is heightened. In addition, the content area of sustainable manufacturing is novel, which adds to the challenge. The two main innovative contributions that are presented in this paper are: (1) an enhanced competence modelling methodology which aids in identifying and structuring relevant contextual factors that have an impact on the performance of the competences in question, and (2) the output of applying this methodology, i.e. a contextually enriched competence model in the field of sustainable manufacturing that can be used to facilitate the design of the TEL content for serious games and simulations. The work presented in the paper is a part of the European Seventh Framework Programme Integrated Project TARGET, the main aim of which is to develop a new genre of TEL environments that can be effectively used in engineering education to support future engineersʼ rapid competence development in the field of sustainable manufacturing.","231717","Open Access","-0.2182","0.3774","5","Competence framework, Competent engineersâ, Engineersâ competence","Competence framework, Competent engineersâ, Engineersâ competence",6,NA,NA,"",""

Thus, the first step in serious game design is to establish an understanding of the particular learning domain, usually through consultation with domain experts. Whilst game design is inherently a creative process, we believe the capturing of the knowledge domain can be systematised and we present a structured approach to knowledge elicitation and representation as a basis for serious game design. We have adapted and extended the applied cognitive task analysis (ACTA) method and have combined it with additional knowledge representation frameworks. We explain how the outputs of this approach can inform the game mechanic and the development of non-player characters, and apply it to the design of a serious game aimed at reducing time-to-competence in soft project management skills for professionals working in corporate environments. A total of 26 domain experts from five different countries were involved in a two-stage interview process. The interviews yielded more than 300 task elements, and information about the cognition underlying the more challenging tasks. This data was incorporated into several representation frameworks and used to indicate features to be implemented in the game and the game mechanics of the supported features. © 2011 International Federation for Information Processing.","231717","Open Access","-0.2225","-0.4934","8","Design, Domain, Game","Design, Domain, Game",2,"1","77","",""
