Such media can be used, for example, to directly extract poorly water?soluble toxic products from fermentations. Likewise many biological reactions require the supply of oxygen, most normally from air. However, reliable online measurements of oxygen concentration in organic solvents (and hence oxygen transfer rates from air to the solvent) has to date proven impossible due to limitations in the current analytical methods. RESULTS For the first time, online oxygen measurements in non?aqueous media using a novel optical sensor are demonstrated. The sensor was used to measure oxygen concentration in various organic solvents including toluene, THF, isooctane, DMF, heptane and hexane (which have all been shown suitable for several biological applications). Subsequently, the oxygen transfer rates from air into these organic solvents were measured. CONCLUSION The measurement of oxygen transfer rates from air into organic solvents using the dynamic method was established using the solvent resistant optical sensor. The feasibility of online oxygen measurements in organic solvents has also been demonstrated, paving the way for new opportunities in process control. ? 2015 The Authors.

After a short presentation of the 
			PSE methods and the bioprocess development drivers, three case studies are presented. 
			In the first example it is demonstrated how experimental investigations of the bi-enzymatic production of lactobionic acid can be modeled with help of a new mechanistic mathematical model. The reaction was performed at lab scale and the prediction quality analyzed. In the second example a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model is used to study mass transfer phenomena in a microreactor. In this example the model is not only used to predict the transient dynamics of the reactor system but also to extract material properties like the diffusion velocities of substrate and product, which is otherwise difficult to access. In the last example, a new approach to the design of microbioreactor layouts using topology optimization is presented and discussed. Finally, the PSE methods are carefully discussed with respect to the complexity of the presented approaches, the applicability with respect to practical considerations and the opportunity to analyze experimental results and transfer the knowledge between different scales.","312148","Open Access","0.2483","0.5579","6","(bio)processes, Computational fluid dynamics (cfd), Modeling","(bio)processes, Computational fluid dynamics (cfd), Modeling",NA,NA,2,"",""
