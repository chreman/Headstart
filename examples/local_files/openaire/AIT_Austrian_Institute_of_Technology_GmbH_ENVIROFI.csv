			The  Model  Web  has  been  proposed  as  a  concept  for  
			integrating     scientific     models
			     in     an     interoperable     and     
			collaborative manner. However, four years after the initial idea 
			was  formulated,  there  is  still  no  stable  long  term  solution.  
			Multiple  authors  propose  Web  
			Service  based  approaches  to  
			model  publication  and  chaining,  but  current  implementations  
			are highly case specific and lack 
			flexibility. This paper discusses 
			the  Web  Service  interfaces,  which  are  required  for  supporting  
			integrated environmental modeling in a sustainable manner. We 
			explore   ways   to   expose   environmental   models   and   their   
			components   using   Web   Service   interfaces.   Our   discussions   
			present  work  in  progress  for  establishing  the  Web  Services  
			technological  grounds  for  simp
			lifying  information  publication  
			and  exchange  within  the  Model  We
			b.  As  a  main  outcome,  this  
			contribution identifies challenges in respect to the required geo-
			processing  and  relates  them  to  currently  available  Web  Service  
			standards.","284898","Open Access","0.4816","0.2214","10","Wsdl","Wsdl",NA,NA,NA,"",""

An increasing part of these phones are smartphones with a broadband internet connection. This growing network of smart internet enabled devices could act as a dense sensing network, as well as a tool for individual informing and tasking of mobile citizens and volunteers.In order to fully harvest this new resource, we need to understand its rules and develop adequate tools. This paper lists some of the peculiarities of ad-hoc volunteer networks supported by smartphones. It furthermore compares the capabilities and limitations of these networks with other means of observation gathering and activity coordination. This includes: (1) a reflection on the motivation for users participation; (2) human and technical limitations of smartphone-enabled volunteer networks; (3) legal and ethical challenges; (4) reliability and usability issues; as well as (5) issues related to trust and quality of information.The second part of the paper presents our experiences with design and prototypic development of the tools supporting volunteer efforts in the field of environmental monitoring, e-health and crisis management.

The sensitivity to different pollutants varies per person, therefore it is important that citizens can get personalised air quality information. The Personal Environmental Information System (PEIS) aims at delivering just that. The PEIS takes sensor data from several data providers and employs a service-oriented architecture to deliver these observations to the user through a smartphone application. The PEIS also uses scientific models to fuse the sensor data and create new, derived observations. To make scientific models that fuse sensor data fit better in a service-oriented architecture, a software framework called Fusion4Decision was developed. This framework is based on Open Geospatial Consortium standards and allows scientific models written in languages like MATLAB or R to be available as a web service.","284898","Open Access","0.0045","0.3231","7","Fusion","Fusion",0,NA,"1","",""

Thus, it is of utmost urgency that the requirements posed by the biodiversity sector are clearly structured and made available for implementation of environmental enablers within the FI. The ENVIROFI project has gone to great lengths so provide these requirements for various environmental domains; of specific relevant to this paper being the biodiversity domain.

Such challenges can only be addressed by a multi-disciplinary approach, in which socio-economic, geospatial, and environmental information becomes inter-connected. However, existing solutions cannot be seamlessly integrated and current interaction paradigms prevent mainstream usage of the existing technology. In particular, it is still difficult to access and join harmonized data and processing algorithms that are provided by different environmental information infrastructures. In this paper we take a novel approach for integrated environmental modelling based on the notion of inter-linked resources on the Web. We present design practices for creating resource-oriented interfaces, driven by an interaction protocol built on the combination of valid linkages to enhance resource integration, accompanied by associated recommendations for implementation. The suggested resource-oriented approach provides a solution to the problems identified above, but still requires intense prototyping and experimentation. We discuss the central open issues and present a roadmap for future research.","284898","Open Access","0.251","-0.106","3","Integrated environmental modelling","Integrated environmental modelling",21,"8","74","",""

The paper incorporates the best aspects of the state-of-the-art in environmental informatics with geospatial solutions and scalable processing capabilities of Internet-based tools. It specifically targets the promotion of the “Environmental Observation Web” as an observation-centric paradigm for building the next generation of environmental applications. In the Environmental Observation Web, the great majority of data are considered as observations. These can be generated from sensors (hardware), numerical simulations (models), as well as by humans (human sensors). Independently from the observation provenance and application scope, data can be represented and processed in a standardised way in order to understand environmental processes and their interdependencies. The development of cross-domain applications is then leveraged by technologies such as Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, Big Data Processing and Analytics. For example, “the cloud” can satisfy the peak-performance needs of applications which may occasionally use large amounts of processing power at a fraction of the price of a dedicated server farm. The paper also addresses the need for Specific Enablers that connect mainstream Future Internet capabilities with sensor and geospatial technologies. Main categories of such Specific Enablers are described with an overall architectural approach for developing environmental applications and exemplar use cases.","284898","Open Access","-0.1958","-0.0226","1","Environmental informatic","Environmental informatic",17,"8","68","",""

The advent of user-generated content for the geospatial domain, Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), makes it even more difficult to establish semantic integration. This paper proposes a novel approach to integrating conventional sensor information and VGI, which is exploited in the context of detecting forest fires. In contrast to common logic-based semantic descriptions, we present a formal system using algebraic specifications to unambiguously describe the processing steps from natural phenomena to value-added information. A generic ontology of observations is extended and profiled for forest fire detection in order to illustrate how the sensing process, and transformations between heterogeneous sensing systems, can be represented as mathematical functions and grouped into abstract data types. We discuss the required ontological commitments and a possible generalization.","284898","Open Access","0.3485","-0.522","5","Haskell","Haskell",4,NA,NA,"",""
