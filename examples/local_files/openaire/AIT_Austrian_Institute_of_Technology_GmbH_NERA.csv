In current practices, it is taken into account in terms of coherency, as a function of frequency and distance, established on an essentially empirical basis, making it difficult to extrapolate at different sites. Hence, in order to improve our understanding of the physical significance of coherency and its relationship to the geometrical and mechanical characteristics of the ground structure, a very dense network was installed in seismically active region of Argostoli-Koutavos (Cephalonia, Greece). Consisting of 21 velocimeters deployed on four concentric circles of radii 5, 15, 40 and 80 m around a central station in a small valley (~50 m thickness, width 1.5 km), the array recorded several hundred events in the period from September 2011 to April 2012. A subset of 46 events having a homogeneous distribution in terms of epicentral distance (0-200 km), back-azimuth (0-360 °) and magnitude (2 to 5) has been selected for a systematic analysis of the coherency of all station pairs observed on 'the most energetic phase' containing the S-wave. The results indicate a lack of a clear dependence of the average coherency on the magnitude, back-azimuth or site-to-source distance of the event, and on the length of chosen signal window provided that it contains the same S-phase energy. The most striking result concerns the influence of the site geometry; the coherency is systematically higher for the pairs aligned parallel to the axis of the valley (2D), and lower for those aligned in the perpendicular direction. This result is consistent with the formation of the wavefield in the valley, dominated by surface waves propagating from one edge to the other. The observed coherency estimates are, however, weakly represented by the existing parametric models.; La variabilité spatiale des mouvements sismiques sur de courtes distances peut affecter significativement la réponse dynamique des structures de génie civil de grande taille, en particulier quand elles sont fondées sur des sites latéralement hétérogènes. Elle est souvent prise en compte au travers de fonctions empiriques – peu calibrées et peu extrapolables d'un site à l'autre-décrivant la perte de cohérenceen fonction de la fréquence et la distance. Dans le but d'améliorer la compréhension de la structure de la cohérence et son lien avec les caractéristiques géométriques et mécaniques du sous-sol, un réseau sismologique très dense a été installé dans la région sismiquement très active d'Argostoli-Koutavos (Céphalonie, Grèce). Constitué de 21 vélocimètres déployés sur 4 cercles concentriques de rayons 5, 15, 40 et 80 m autour d'une station centrale au sein d'une vallée de petite taille (épaisseur ~50 m, largeur 1.5 km), ce réseau a enregistré plusieurs centaines d'événements sur la période septembre 2011-avril 2012. Un sous ensemble de 46 événements présentant une distribution homogène en termes de distance épicentrale (0-200 km), back-azimut (0-360°) et magnitude (2 à 5) a été sélectionné pour une analyse systématique de la cohérence observée sur la phase forte comprenant l'onde S de toutes les paires de stations. Les résultats indiquent une absence de dépendance claire de la cohérence moyenne en fonction de la magnitude, du back-azimut de la source, et de la distance hypocentrale, ainsi qu'une grande robustesse vis-à-vis de la fenêtre de signal choisie, pour peu qu'elle contienne la phase S énergétique. Le résultat le plus marquant concerne le contrôle par la géométrie du site : la cohérence est systématiquement plus forte pour les paires alignées parallèlement à l'axe de la vallée (2D), et minimale pour celles alignées selon la direction perpendiculaire. Ce résultat est cohérent avec la constitution du champ d'ondes dans la vallée dominé par des ondes de surface se propageant d'un bord à l'autre de la vallée. Les cohérences observées ne sont par ailleurs que très partiellement expliquées par les modèles existants.","262330","Open Access","0.5921","0.36","6","Cohérence","Cohérence",NA,NA,NA,"",""

We are observing seismicity that is primarily concentrated in very limited regions along the 1980 Irpinia earthquake fault zone in Southern Italy, which is a complex system characterised by extensional stress regime. These zones of weakness produce repeated earthquakes and swarm-like microearthquake sequences, which are concentrated in a few specific zones of the fault system. In this study, we focused on a sequence that occurred along the main fault segment of the 1980 Irpinia earthquake to understand its characteristics and its relation to the loading-unloading mechanisms of the fault system.","282862","Open Access","0.4954","-0.0172","12","Article","Article","16","2","34","",""

This study is jointly carried out by academic institutions (the Swiss Seismological Service at ETHZ and BRGM) and in cooperation with swissnuclear, the nuclear energy section of swisselectric, an umbrella organisation for the nuclear power plants in Switzerland, which provide about 40% of the electricity needs of the country. Briefly presented in this contribution are the main investigations carried out and results obtained throughout the development of this task, with special focus on: a) evaluating the performances of the selected EEW algorithm (the Virtual Seismologist, VS) in Switzerland and California, in terms of correct detections, false alerts, and missed events; b) embedding the VS algorithm into the earthquake monitoring software SeisComP3 (www.seiscomp3.org) routinely used by the Swiss Seismological Service for earthquake detections and locations; c) customising the User Display (a graphical interface originally developed at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) during Phase II of the ShakeAlert project in California) for optimised use at Swiss NPPs; d) presenting synthetic time-dependent hazard scenarios for Switzerland and e) attempting to associate the above input data with potential mitigation actions and related cost and benefits for NPPs in Switzerland.","282862","Open Access","0.5882","-0.3024","10","Earthquake early warning","Earthquake early warning","",NA,NA,"",""
