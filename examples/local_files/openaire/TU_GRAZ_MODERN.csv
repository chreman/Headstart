A maioria das investigações com esta faixa etária não avalia o desenvolvimento pubertário, tendo apenas em atenção a idade ou ao sexo dos participantes. Assim, este estudo tem como objetivo desenvolver uma versão portuguesa da “Self-rating Scale for Pubertal Development” (SSPD, Carskadon & Acebo, 1993, baseando-se em Petersen et al., 1988) e ainda verificar se existem associações entre alguns sintomas psicopatológicos e o estádio de desenvolvimento pubertário. Usámos dois questionários: a Escala de Autoavaliação de Puberdade (EAP - versão experimental portuguesa do SSPD de Crisóstomo, Couto, Marques & Gomes, 2012) e a versão portuguesa (Gonçalves, Dias & Machado, s/d) do inventário de sintomas psicopatológicos de Achenbach (2001), Youth Self Report (YSR) para idades dos 11-18. A EAP é um questionário breve, de autorrelato, destinado a crianças/jovens a partir dos 9 anos. É uma escala do tipo Likert, com 4 opções de resposta na maioria dos itens, contendo duas questões específicas por género. A nossa amostra foi composta por 431 crianças/jovens (49,0% do sexo masculino), com idades compreendidas entre os 9 e os 15 anos de idade, a frequentar do 3º ao 9º ano de escolaridade, que responderam à EAP após o seu acordo e o consentimento informado dos encarregados de educação. Uma subamostra (de 241 participantes, 49% dos quais rapazes) respondeu também ao YSR. Os resultados mostraram que a EAP apresentou características psicométricas satisfatórias com alfas de Cronbach de 0,81 na versão masculina e 0,74 na versão feminina, sugestivos de consistência interna adequada. As correlações item-total corrigido situaram-se entre 0,31 e 0,66. Como espectável, as pontuações médias na EAP mostraram-se estatisticamente correlacionadas com a idade (r=,691 nos rapazes e r=,625 nas raparigas) e foram significativamente superiores nas raparigas (2,26 ± 0,68) comparativamente com os rapazes (1,96 ± 0,64), p < 0,001, o que aponta para a validade da escala. Para além disso verificaram-se várias associações entre o estádio de desenvolvimento pubertário e alguns sintomas psicológicos, principalmente no caso das raparigas. No sexo feminino, o desenvolvimento pubertário associou-se de forma significativa com mais escalas do YSR (I, II, V, VII, VIII, internalização e externalização) do que a idade. Estes resultados vão ao encontro da literatura anterior. Os resultados do presente estudo apontam para a importância de se avaliar o desenvolvimento pubertário aquando da avaliação e intervenção com adolescentes no âmbito da psicologia clínica e da saúde. São ainda discutidas algumas limitações deste estudo e sugestões para investigações futuras.
			Adolescence is a period of great changes at various levels. Most research with this age group does not assess pubertal development, taking only into account the age or sex of participants. Thus, the aims of this study were to develop a Portuguese version of the “Self-rating Scale for Pubertal Development” (SSPD, Carskadon & Acebo, 1993, based in Petersen et al., 1988), and to examine if there were associations between psychopathological symptoms and pubertal development stages. We used two questionnaires: EAP (the Portuguese experimental version of SSPD, Crisóstomo, Couto, Marques & Gomes (2012)) and the Achenbach (2001) inventory Youth Self Report (YSR), Portuguese version of Gonçalves, Dias & Machado (s/d). The EAP/SSPD is a brief self-rating scale for children from the age of 9. It is a 4-point Likert scale with two specific questions by gender. Our sample was composed by 431 children (49,0% male), aged between 9 and 15 years old, and attending 3rd to 9th grades, who completed the EAP after informed consent. A sub-sample (241 participants, 49,0% males) answered also to the YSR. The results showed adequate internal consistency of EAP, as indicated by Cronbach alphas .81 in male version and .74 in female version. Corrected item-total correlations ranged from .31 to .66. As expected, mean EAP scores were both statistically related with age (r = .691 in boys, and r = .625 in girls), and significantly higher in girls (2.26 ± 0.68) than in boys (1.96 ± 0.64), p < .001, thus supporting the validity of the scale. In addition, there were several associations between pubertal development stage and some psychological symptoms, mainly in girls. In female students pubertal development was associated with a higher number of YSR scales (I, II, V,VII, VIII, internalizing and externalizing) than age. These results are in line with previous literature in the area, and point to the pertinence of considering pubertal status when assessing mental health in adolescents. Some limitations of this study are also addressed, as well as suggestions for future research.

Apesar do crescente volume de investigação sobre estes temas, os estudos com recurso a métodos objectivos para estimar padrões de sono são menos numerosos. Assim, o presente trabalho tem como objetivo estudar os padrões de sono em crianças, usando um método objetivo, e a sua associação com sintomas emocionais e comportamentais.
			A amostra incluiu 80 crianças, 34 do sexo masculino e 46 do sexo feminino, com idades compreendidas entre os 4 e os 11 anos (M=7.65; DP=1.77), a frequentar do Jardim de Infância ao 6º ano de escolaridade. Cada criança utilizou um actígrafo durante 7 a 14 noites/dias consecutivos para medição dos padrões de sono, e os pais/encarregados de educação e educadores/professores preencheram o Questionário de Capacidades e Dificuldades (Strenghts and Difficulties Questionnaire – SDQ, Goodman, 1997) para avaliação dos sintomas emocionais e comportamentais.
			Os resultados revelaram uma associação significativa (p < 0.05) entre a Eficiência do Sono ao fim-de-semana e Problemas de Comportamento (r=-.249) para o SDQ-Versão Pais. No SDQ-Versão Professores verificaram-se associações entre o Ponto Médio de Sono em dias de escola e Sintomas Emocionais (r=-.284), entre a Hora de Levantar ao fim-de-semana e Problemas de Comportamento (r=.311) e Hiperatividade (r=.320), entre o Período de Sono ao fim-de-semana e a Hiperatividade (r=.285), e entre o Ponto Médio de Sono ao fim-de-semana e Problemas de Comportamento (r=.281).
			Os resultados do presente estudo apontam para a associação entre algumas variáveis de sono e problemas comportamentais e emocionais. Neste sentido, poderá ser pertinente uma especial atenção, por parte dos profissionais de saúde, relativamente aos hábitos e dificuldades de sono quando avaliam ou intervêm em crianças com problemas emocionais ou de comportamento. No entanto, é necessário investigação futura para esclarecer o sentido destas associações.
			Sleep is one of the main predictors of a healthy child development, and alterations on sleep patterns have been associated to emotional and behavioral problems in children. Although the growing body of research on this matter, studies using objective measures to estimate sleep patterns are less numerous. Therefore, the present work aimed to study children’s sleep patterns, using an objective measure, and its associations with emotional and behavioral symptoms.
			The selected sample included 80 Portuguese children, 34 males and 46 females, with ages ranging from 4 to 11 years old (M=7.65; SD=1.77), attending kindergarten to 6th grade. Each child used an actigraph for 7 to 14 consecutive nights/days, to measure sleep patterns, and their parents/tutors and educators/teachers completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ, Goodman, 1997; 2001) in order to evaluate emotional and behavioral symptoms.
			The results revealed a significant association between Sleep Efficiency on weekends and Behavioral Problems (r=-.249) on the SDQ-Parents Version. For the SDQ-Teacher Version, the results revealed associations between the Mid Sleep Point on school days and Emotional Symptoms (r=-.284), between Rise Time on weekends and Behavioral Problems (r=.311) and Hyperactivity (r=.320), between Sleep Period on weekends and Hyperactivity (r=.285), and between Mid Sleep Point on weekends and Behavioral Problems (r=.281).
			The results of the present study point to associations between some sleep variables and emotional and behavioral symptoms. Thus, it might be relevant for health professionals to pay special attention to sleep habits and difficulties when evaluating or intervening on children with emotional or behavioral problems. However, there is still a need for future investigation to clarify the direction of these associations.

Einstein gauge (comparable to Einstein frame in Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory) is most natural for studying trajectories. In it, the Weylian scale connection induces an additional acceleration which in the weak field, static, low velocity limit acquires the deep MOND form of Milgrom/Bekenstein's gravity. The energy momentum of $\Phi$ leads to another add on to Newton acceleration. Both additional accelerations together imply a MOND-ian phenomenology of the model. It has unusual transition functions. They imply higher phantom energy density than in the case of the more common MOND models with transition functions $\mu_1(x), \, \mu_2(x)$. A considerable part of it is due to the scalar field's energy density which, in our model, gives a scale and generally covariant expression for the self-energy of the gravitational field.","120003","Open Access","-0.6517","-0.3028","12","General relativity and quantum cosmology","General relativity and quantum cosmology",4,NA,NA,"",""

The TL is a technology independent method, which aims to improve error tolerance when these errors are caused by noise within logic and functional units, sequential elements, and in general synchronous pipeline Finite State Machines. Turtle Logic operation is based on the consistency relation of redundant inputs. In the case of discrepancy, the out put of the system keeps the previous value, therefore avoiding the propagation of incorrect inputs. A two’s complement 8x8-bit pipelined Baugh–Wooley multiplier is implemented, on which several experiments reveal a perfect tolerance (0%errors) to single line discrepancies for both primary and internal nodes, with a cost of lost clock periods between 6% and 25%. The error ratio for the proposed Turtle Logic implementation with double discrepancies in both true and complementary lines are lower  than 0.1% when the noise affects primary input nodes, and lower than 0.9% when the noise affects internal nodes.","120003","Restricted","0.1152","-0.2845","14",":enginyeria electrònica::microelectrònica [àrees temàtiques de la upc]",":enginyeria electrònica::microelectrònica [àrees temàtiques de la upc]",2,NA,NA,"",""

The present study was designed to characterize the pharmacological profiles of CMD-05, a novel DPP-IV inhibitor discovered in our laboratory, in vitro and in vivo. The IC50 of CMD-05 on DPP-IV inhibitory activity was approximately 12?nM while vildagliptin was 3.5?nM in vitro. In diabetes rat model established by high fat diet/low dose streptozotocin, CMD-05 inhibited DPP-IV activity, significantly improved glucose tolerance, increased GLP-1 and insulin levels in plasma. Long-term administration of CMD-05 decreased HbA1c and TG levels and improved the islet function without significantly effect on body weight. Furthermore, CMD-05 reduced INS-1 cell apoptosis and increased GLP-1 secretion in NCI-H716. After oral administration, CMD-05 reached peak concentration at 30?min with half-life of 288?minutes and the inhibitory rate of DPP-IV greater than 50% lasted for 15?h. In fasted normal rats, CMD-05 didn?t cause significant hypoglycemia. CMD-05 had a lower cytotoxicity than vildagliptin in vitro and its maximum tolerance dose in mice is beyond 2000?mg/kg. These results indicated that CMD-05 has similar activity with vildagliptin in vivo and has a much longer half-life and lower cytotoxicity than vildagliptin.","120003","Open Access","0.4347","0.0183","7","Article","Article",0,NA,NA,"",""

Based on Lyapunov function approach, sufficient conditions are established for the resulting closed-loop discrete-time system with Markovian jumps to be stochastic ℋ∞ finite-time boundedness and then state feedback controllers are designed to guarantee stochastic ℋ∞ finite-time stabilization of the class of stochastic systems. The stochastic ℋ∞ finite-time boundedness criteria can be tackled in the form of linear matrix inequalities with a fixed parameter. As an auxiliary result, we also give sufficient conditions on the robust stochastic stabilization of the class of linear systems with packet loss. Finally, simulation examples are presented to illustrate the validity of the developed scheme.","120003","Open Access","-0.4722","0.2412","4","Mathematics, Control of discrete, Systems with packet","Mathematics, Control of discrete, Systems with packet",1,"1","1","",""

To evaluate the corneal aberration changes in dry eye patients after treatment with artificial eye drops. Methods. Thirty mild to moderate dry eye patients treated with artificial eye drops and twenty comparable dry eye patients were recruited as controls. Anterior corneal aberrations over 3?mm and 5?mm analytical zones including total, 3rd to 5th high order aberrations (HOAs), spherical aberration (SA), and vertical (V-coma) and horizontal coma (H-coma) obtained from corneal topography data at baseline and 2 weeks after treatment were evaluated. Results. For 3?mm zone, trefoils, V-coma, H-coma terms, and 3rd and 5th HOAs were significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in the treatment group. For 5?mm zone, instillation of eye drops reduced H-coma, SA terms, 3rd to 5th orders, and total HOAs all showed a significant decrease (p < 0.05). The root mean square analysis of the Zernike terms also showed similar statistical results. For control group, all individual terms and total HOAs did not have significant changes over 3?mm and 5?mm zones (p > 0.05). Conclusions. Treatment with artificial eye drops can effectively improve the corneal optical quality of dry eye patients by ameliorating the HOAs of anterior corneal surface.","120003","Open Access","-0.0259","0.7087","10","Clinical study","Clinical study",1,NA,NA,"",""

The formula was developed with the aim of improving weight control. We investigated the anti-obesity effect of HOX-7 on high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced obesity in C57BL/6 mice. Methods The mice were divided into four groups and were fed a normal diet (ND), HFD, or HFD with oral administration of HOX-7 at 100 or 200?mg/kg/day for 12?weeks. Body and fat weight, histological changes of fat tissue, and the expression of key adipogenic transcription factors were investigated. Results The body weight of mice fed the HFD with HOX-7 was significantly decreased compared to the HFD group. There were no obvious differences in weekly food intake among the 4 groups. The weight of the epididymal and total fat pads was reduced in mice fed the HFD with HOX-7. Treatment with HOX-7 also substantially attenuated the expression of key adipogenic transcription factors, including peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor ?, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein ?, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c, adipocyte P2, liver X receptor, and lipoprotein lipase in the epididymal adipose tissue. Conclusion Overall, this study highlighted the anti-obesity effects of HOX-7, a finding that could contribute to the development of natural anti-obesity herbal medicines.","120003","Open Access","0.466","0.3603","8","Adipogenesis related gene, Adiponectin and leptin, Administration to arthritic","Adipogenesis related gene, Adiponectin and leptin, Administration to arthritic",2,NA,NA,"",""

In arthritic rats, fenofibrate, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? (PPAR? (PPARA)) agonist, reduces wasting of gastrocnemius, a predominantly glycolytic muscle, by decreasing atrogenes and myostatin. Considering that fenofibrate increases fatty acid oxidation, the aim of this study was to elucidate whether fenofibrate is able to prevent the effect of arthritis on serum adipokines and on soleus, a type I muscle in which oxidative metabolism is the dominant source of energy. Arthritis was induced by injection of Freund's adjuvant. Four days after the injection, control and arthritic rats were gavaged daily with fenofibrate (300?mg/kg bw) or vehicle over 12 days. Arthritis decreased serum leptin, adiponectin, and insulin (P<0.01) but not resistin levels. In arthritic rats, fenofibrate administration increased serum concentrations of leptin and adiponectin. Arthritis decreased soleus weight, cross-sectional area, fiber size, and its Ppar ? mRNA expression. In arthritic rats, fenofibrate increased soleus weight, fiber size, and Ppar ? expression and prevented the increase in Murf1 mRNA. Fenofibrate decreased myostatin, whereas it increased MyoD (Myod1) and myogenin expressions in the soleus of control and arthritic rats. These data suggest that in oxidative muscle, fenofibrate treatment is able to prevent arthritis-induced muscle wasting by decreasing Murf1 and myostatin expression and also by increasing the myogenic regulatory factors, MyoD and myogenin. Taking into account the beneficial action of adiponectin on muscle wasting and the correlation between adiponectin and soleus mass, part of the anticachectic action of fenofibrate may be mediated through stimulation of adiponectin secretion.","120003","Open Access","0.6736","0.274","8","Adipogenesis related gene, Adiponectin and leptin, Administration to arthritic","Adipogenesis related gene, Adiponectin and leptin, Administration to arthritic",3,"2","11","",""

Endothelial cells are involved in a number of important biological processes, and are a major source of circulating exosomes. In this study, we prepared exosomes from endothelial cells and evaluated their capacity to deliver siRNA into primary endothelial cells. Exosomes were isolated and purified by sequential centrifugation and ultracentrifugation from cultured mouse aortic endothelial cells. Similar to exosome particles from other cell sources, endothelial exosomes are nanometer-size vesicles, examined by both the NanoSight instrument and transmission electron microscopy. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis confirmed the expression of two exosome markers: CD9&amp;nbsp;and CD63. Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy studies demonstrated that endothelial exosomes were heterogeneously distributed within cells. In a gene-silencing study with luciferase-expressing endothelial cells, exosomes loaded with siRNA inhibited luciferase expression by more than 40%. In contrast, siRNA alone and control siRNA only suppressed luciferase expression by less than 15%. In conclusion, we demonstrated that endothelial exosomes have the capability to accommodate and deliver short foreign nucleic acids into endothelial cells.

Both microscopy and NanoSight Tracking Analysis (NTA) for size distribution have been used to detect large vesicles. However, there is currently no well-established method that is convenient for routine quality analysis of small-size impurities in vesicle samples. In this paper we report a convenient method, called ‘size- exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography’ (SE- HPLC), alongside NTA and Microscopy analysis to guide and qualify the isolation and processing of vesicles. First, the SE-HPLC analysis was used to detect impurities of small-size proteins during the ultra-centrifugation process of vesicle isolation; it was then employed to test the changes of vesicles under different pH conditions or integrity after storage. As SE-HPLC is generally accessible in most institutions, it could be used as a routine means to assist researchers in examining the integrity and quality of extracellular vesicles along with other techniques either during isolation/preparation or for further engineering and storage.","1R21HL120003-01A1","Open Access","0.4995","-0.461","15","Extracellular vesicles, Quality analysis","Extracellular vesicles, Quality analysis",1,NA,NA,"",""
