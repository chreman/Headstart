C, Nanomaterials and Interfaces","","The work function of metal substrates can be easily tuned, for instance, by adsorbing layers of molecular electron donors and acceptors. In this work, we discuss the possibility of changing the donor/acceptor mixing ratio reversibly after adsorption by choosing a donor/acceptor pair that is coupled via a redox reaction and that is in equilibrium with a surrounding gas phase. We discuss such a situation for the example of tetrafluoro-1,4-benzenediol (TFBD)/tetrafluoro-1,4-benzoquinone (TFBQ), adsorbed on Cu(111) and Ag(111) surfaces. We use density functional theory and ab initio thermodynamics to show that arbitrary TFBD/TFBQ mixing ratios can be set using hydrogen pressures attainable in low to ultrahigh vacuum. Adjusting the mixing ratio allows modifying the work function over a range of about 1 eV. Finally, we contrast single-species submonolayers with mixed layers to discuss why the resulting inhomogeneities in the electrostatic energy above the surface have different impacts on the interfacial level alignment and the work function.","J 3285","Open Access","0.1531","0.5177","6","Article","Article",3,NA,NA,"",""

C, Nanomaterials and Interfaces","","Reduced Langevin recombination has been observed in organic solar cells (OSCs) for many years, but its origin is still unclear. A recent work by Burke et al. ( Adv. Energy Mater. 2015, 5, 1500123-1 ) was inspired by this reduced Langevin recombination, and they proposed an equilibrium model of charge-transfer (CT) states that correlates the open-circuit voltage of OSCs with experimentally available device parameters. In this work, we extend Burke et al.?s CT model further and for the first time directly correlate the reduced Langevin recombination with the energetic and dynamic behavior of the CT state. Recombination through CT states leads in a straightforward manner to a decrease in the Langevin reduction factor with increasing temperature, without explicit consideration of the temperature dependence of the mobility. To verify the correlation between the CT states and reduced Langevin recombination, we incorporated this CT model and the reduced Langevin model into drift-diffusion simulations of a bilayer OSC. The simulations not only successfully reproduced realistic current?voltage (J?V) characteristics of the bilayer OSC, but also demonstrate that the two models consistently lead to same value of the apparent Langevin reduction factor.","V 317","Open Access","-0.448","-0.4178","3","Organic solar cells, Article","Organic solar cells, Article",11,NA,NA,"",""

Molecular Configuration of Chloro Boron-Subphthalocyanine on Cu(111)","Ilyas, Nahid","2016-03-01","American Chemical Society","publication","","The Journal of Physical Chemistry. C, Nanomaterials and Interfaces","","In this combined low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT) study, we investigate self-assembly of the dipolar nonplanar organic semiconductor chloro boron-subphthalocyanine (ClB-SubPc) on Cu(111). We observe multiple distinct adsorption configurations and demonstrate that these can only be understood by taking surface-catalyzed dechlorination into account. A detailed investigation of possible adsorption configurations and the comparison of experimental and computational STM images demonstrates that the configurations correspond to ?Cl-up? molecules with the B?Cl moiety pointing toward the vacuum side of the interface, and dechlorinated molecules. In contrast to the standard interpretation of adsorption of nonplanar molecules in the phthalocyanine family, we find no evidence for ?Cl-down? molecules where the B?Cl moiety would be pointing toward the Cu surface. We show computationally that such a configuration is unstable and thus is highly unlikely to occur for ClB-SubPc on Cu(111). Using these assignments, we discuss the different self-assembly motifs in the submonolayer coverage regime. The combination of DFT and STM is essential to gain a full atomistic understanding of the surface?molecule interactions, and our findings imply that phthalocyanines may undergo surface-catalyzed reactions hitherto not considered. Our results also indicate that care has to be taken when analyzing possible adsorption configurations of polar members of the phthalocyanine family, especially when they are adsorbed on comparably reactive surfaces like Cu(111).","1213243","Open Access","-0.3014","0.522","5","Article","Article",3,"1","7","",""

These approaches? effects on the light absorption enhancement have been widely studied, especially in inorganic devices. While this light-trapping concept can be transferred to organic devices, one has to also consider nanostructure-induced electrical effects on the device performance, due to the fundamental difference in the organic semiconducting material properties compared to their inorganic counterparts. In this contribution, we exemplarily model the electrical properties of organic solar cells with rectangular-grating structures, as compared to planar reference devices. Based on our numeric results, we demonstrate that, beyond an optical absorption enhancement, the device fill factor improves significantly by introducing the grating structures. From the simulations we conclude that enhanced carrier collection efficiency is the main reason for the increased solar cell fill factor. This work contributes towards a more fundamental understanding of the effect of nanostructured electrodes on the electrical properties of organic solar cells.","607232","Open Access","0.0074","-0.5663","3","Organic solar cells, Article","Organic solar cells, Article",3,NA,NA,"",""

For physisorbed molecules, where the interaction with graphene is dominated by van der Waals forces and the system is non-magnetic in the ground state, numerical simulations based on density functional theory show that the valence electrons relax towards a spin polarized configuration upon excitation of a core-level electron. The magnetism depends on efficient electron transfer from graphene on the femtosecond time scale. On the other hand, when graphene is covalently functionalized, the system is magnetic in the ground state showing two spin dependent mid gap states localized around the adsorption site. At variance with the physisorbed case upon core-level excitation, the LUMO of the molecule and the mid gap states of graphene hybridize and the relaxed valence shell is not magnetic anymore.","607232","Open Access","-0.531","0.1","1","Settore fis/03 - fisica della materia","Settore fis/03 - fisica della materia",5,"8","10","",""

The achievement of efficient near-infrared electroluminescence from solution-processed OLEDs is, however, an open challenge due to the low photoluminescence efficiency of most narrow-energy-gap organic emitters. Diketopyrrolopyrrole-boron complexes are promising candidates to overcome this limitation as they feature extremely high photoluminescence quantum yield in the near-infrared region and high chemical stability. Here, by incorporating suitably functionalized diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives emitting at ~760?nm in an active matrix of poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-benzothiadiazole) and without using complex light out-coupling or encapsulation strategies, we obtain all-solution-processed NIR-OLEDs with external quantum efficiency as high as 0.5%. Importantly, our test-bed devices show no efficiency roll-off even for high current densities and high operational stability, retaining over 50% of the initial radiant emittance for over 50?hours of continuous operation at 10?mA/cm2, which emphasizes the great applicative potential of the proposed strategy.","607232","Open Access","0.4565","-0.3628","4","Article","Article",5,NA,NA,"",""
