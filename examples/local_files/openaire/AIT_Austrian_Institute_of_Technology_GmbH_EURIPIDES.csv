In this pilot study we used positron emission tomography (PET) to assess brain distribution of two model ABCB1/ABCG2 substrates ([11C]elacridar and [11C]tariquidar) in healthy subjects without (c.421CC) or with (c.421CA) the ABCG2 single?nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) c.421C>A. Subjects underwent PET scans under conditions when ABCB1 and ABCG2 were functional and during ABCB1 inhibition with high?dose tariquidar. In contrast to the ABCB1?selective substrate (R)?[11C]verapamil, [11C]elacridar and [11C]tariquidar showed only moderate increases in brain distribution during ABCB1 inhibition. This provides evidence for a functional interplay between ABCB1 and ABCG2 at the human BBB and suggests that both ABCB1 and ABCG2 need to be inhibited to achieve substantial increases in brain distribution of dual ABCB1/ABCG2 substrates. During ABCB1 inhibition c.421CA subjects had significantly higher increases in [11C]tariquidar brain distribution than c.421CC subjects, pointing to impaired cerebral ABCG2 function.","KLI 480","Open Access","0.1312","0.5256","12","Glycoprotein function, Human blood brain, Pet study","Glycoprotein function, Human blood brain, Pet study","1","19","10","",""

			          Purpose
			          The aim of this study was to assess the influence of age on the functional activity of the multidrug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) at the human blood-brain barrier.
			        
			        
			          Methods
			          Seven young (mean age: 27???4 years) and six elderly (mean age: 69???9 years) healthy volunteers underwent dynamic (R)-[11C]verapamil (VPM) positron emission tomography (PET) scans and arterial blood sampling. Parametric distribution volume (DV) images were generated using Logan linearisation, and age groups were compared with statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Brain regions that SPM analysis had shown to be most affected by age were analysed by a region of interest (ROI)-based approach using a maximum probability brain atlas, before and after partial volume correction (PVC).
			        
			        
			          Results
			          SPM analysis revealed significant clusters of DV increases in cerebellum, temporal and frontal lobe of elderly compared to younger subjects. In the ROI-based analysis, elderly subjects showed significant DV increases in amygdala (+30%), insula (+26%) and cerebellum (+25%) before PVC, and in insula (+33%) after PVC.
			        
			        
			          Conclusions
			          Increased VPM DV values in the brains of elderly subjects suggest a decrease in cerebral P-gp function with increasing age.

Loss of Pgp function with increasing age may be involved in the development of age-related disorders, but this may differ between males and females. Pgp function can be quantified in vivo using (R)-[11C]verapamil and positron emission tomography. The purpose of this study was to assess global and regional effects of both age and gender on BBB Pgp function. Procedures Thirty-five healthy men and women in three different age groups were included. Sixty minutes dynamic (R)-[11C]verapamil scans with metabolite-corrected arterial plasma input curves were acquired. Grey matter time–activity curves were fitted to a validated constrained two-tissue compartment plasma input model, providing the volume of distribution (V T) of (R)-[11C]verapamil as outcome measure. Results Increased V T of (R)-[11C]verapamil with aging was found in several large brain regions in men. Young and elderly women showed comparable V T values. Young women had higher V T compared with young men. Conclusions Decreased BBB Pgp is found with aging; however, effects of age on BBB Pgp function differ between men and women.","201380","Open Access","0.3062","-0.0253","12","Glycoprotein function, Human blood brain, Pet study","Glycoprotein function, Human blood brain, Pet study","1","51","31","",""

The advantage of PET, when compared to other analytical methods used in microdose studies, is that the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a drug can be determined in the tissue targeted for drug treatment. PET microdosing already offers interesting applications in clinical oncology and in the development of central nervous system pharmaceuticals and is extending its range of application to many other fields of pharmaceutical medicine. Although requirements for preclinical safety testing for microdose studies have been cut down by regulatory authorities, radiopharmaceuticals increasingly need to be produced under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions, which increases the costs of PET microdosing studies. Further challenges in PET microdosing include combining PET with other ultrasensitive analytical methods, such as accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), to gain plasma PK data of drugs, beyond the short PET examination periods. Finally, conducting clinical PET studies with radiolabeled drugs both at micro- and therapeutic doses is encouraged to answer the question of dose linearity in clinical microdosing.","201380","Open Access","0.0962","0.6691","7","Small animal pet, Pet microdosing study, Animal pet evaluation","Small animal pet, Pet microdosing study, Animal pet evaluation",NA,NA,"56","",""

O-desmethyl-1 was synthesized and reacted with [11C]methyl triflate to afford [11C]-1. Small-animal PET imaging of [11C]-1 was performed in naïve rats, before and after administration of unlabeled 1 (15 mg/kg, n=3) or the dual P-gp/BCRP inhibitor elacridar (5 mg/kg, n=2), as well as in wild-type, Mdr1a/b(−/−), Bcrp1(−/−) and Mdr1a/b(−/−)Bcrp1(−/−) mice (n=3). In vitro autoradiography was performed with [11C]-1 using brain sections of all 4 mouse types, with and without co-incubation with unlabeled 1 or elacridar (1 μM). In PET experiments in rats, administration of unlabeled 1 or elacridar increased brain activity uptake by a factor of 3-4, whereas blood activity levels remained unchanged. In Mdr1a/b(−/−), Bcrp1(−/−) and Mdr1a/b(−/−)Bcrp1(−/−) mice, brain-to-blood ratios of activity at 25 min after tracer injection were 3.4, 1.8 and 14.5 times higher, respectively, as compared to wild-type animals. Autoradiography showed approximately 50% less [11C]-1 binding in transporter knockout mice compared to wild-type mice and significant displacement by unlabeled elacridar in wild-type and Mdr1a/b(−/−) mouse brains. Our data suggest that [11C]-1 interacts specifically with P-gp and BCRP in the BBB. However, further investigations are needed to assess if [11C]-1 behaves in vivo as a transported or a non-transported inhibitor.","201380","Open Access","0.1415","0.4022","1","Resistance protein, Positron emission tomography, Article","Resistance protein, Positron emission tomography, Article",NA,NA,"34","",""

In search for a positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer to visualise Pgp expression levels at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), we examined the ability of HM30181 to inhibit Pgp at the murine BBB. HM30181 was shown to be approximately equipotent with the reference Pgp inhibitor tariquidar in inhibiting rhodamine 123 efflux from CCRF-CEM T cells (IC50, tariquidar: 8.2±2.0 nM, HM30181: 13.1±2.3 nM). PET scans with the Pgp substrate (R)-[11C]verapamil in FVB wild-type mice pretreated i.v. with HM30181 (10 or 21 mg/kg) failed to show significant increases in (R)-[11C]verapamil brain uptake compared with vehicle treated animals. PET scans with [11C]HM30181 showed low and not significantly different brain uptake of [11C]HM30181 in wild-type, Mdr1a/b(−/−) and Bcrp1(−/−) mice and significantly, i.e. 4.7-fold (P<0.01), higher brain uptake, relative to wild-type animals, in Mdr1a/b(−/−)Bcrp1(−/−) mice. This was consistent with HM30181 being at microdoses a dual substrate of Pgp and breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp). In vitro autoradiography on low (EMT6) and high (EMT6Ar1.0) Pgp expressing murine breast tumour sections showed 1.9 times higher binding of [11C]HM30181 in EMT6Ar1.0 tumours (P<0.001) which was displaceable with unlabelled tariquidar, elacridar or HM30181 (1 μM).

We performed paired PET scans in rats, wild-type (FVB) and Mdr1a/b(−/−) mice, before and after intravenous administration of the Pgp inhibitor tariquidar (15 mg/kg). Brain-to-blood AUC0-60 ratios in rats and brain AUC0-60 values of [11C]mephobarbital in wild-type and Mdr1a/b(−/−) mice were similar in scan 1 and scan 2, respectively, suggesting that in vivo brain distribution of [11C]mephobarbital is not influenced by Pgp efflux. Absence of Pgp transport was confirmed in vitro by performing concentration equilibrium transport assay in cell lines transfected with MDR1 or Mdr1a. PET experiments in wild-type mice, with and without pretreatment with the multidrug resistance protein (MRP) inhibitor MK571 (20 mg/kg), and in Mrp1(−/−) mice suggested that [11C]mephobarbital is also not transported by MRPs at the murine BBB, which was also supported by in vitro transport experiments using human MRP1-transfected cells. Our results are surprising as phenobarbital, the N-desmethyl derivative of mephobarbital, has been shown to be a substrate of Pgp, which suggests that N-methylation abolishes Pgp affinity of barbiturates.","201380","Open Access","0.0537","0.1175","1","Resistance protein, Positron emission tomography, Article","Resistance protein, Positron emission tomography, Article",NA,NA,"6","",""

There is some evidence in literature that verapamil inhibits two other ABC transporters expressed at the BBB, i.e. multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). However, previous data were obtained with micromolar concentrations of verapamil and do not necessarily reflect the transporter selectivity of verapamil at nanomolar concentrations, which are relevant for PET experiments. The aim of this study was to assess the selectivity of verapamil, in nanomolar concentrations, for Pgp over MRP1 and BCRP. Methods Concentration equilibrium transport assays were performed with [3H]verapamil (5?nM) in cell lines expressing murine or human Pgp, human MRP1, and murine Bcrp1 or human BCRP. Paired PET scans were performed with (R)-[11C]verapamil in female FVB/N (wild-type), Mrp1(?/?) , Mdr1a/b(?/?) , Bcrp1(?/?) and Mdr1a/b(?/?)Bcrp1(?/?) mice, before and after Pgp inhibition with 15?mg/kg tariquidar. Results In vitro transport experiments exclusively showed directed transport of [3H]verapamil in Mdr1a- and MDR1-overexpressing cells which could be inhibited by tariquidar (0.5??M). In PET scans acquired before tariquidar administration, brain-to-blood ratio (K b,brain) of (R)-[11C]verapamil was low in wild-type (1.3???0.1), Mrp1(?/?) (1.4???0.1) and Bcrp1(?/?) mice (1.8???0.1) and high in Mdr1a/b(?/?) (6.9???0.8) and Mdr1a/b(?/?)Bcrp1(?/?) mice (7.9???0.5). In PET scans after tariquidar administration, K b,brain was significantly increased in Pgp-expressing mice (wild-type: 5.0???0.3-fold, Mrp1(?/?) : 3.2???0.6-fold, Bcrp1(?/?) : 4.3???0.1-fold) but not in Pgp knockout mice (Mdr1a/b(?/?) and Mdr1a/b(?/?)Bcrp1(?/?) ). Conclusion Our combined in vitro and in vivo data demonstrate that verapamil, in nanomolar concentrations, is selectively transported by Pgp and not by MRP1 and BCRP at the BBB, which supports the use of (R)-[11C]verapamil or racemic [11C]verapamil as PET tracers of cerebral Pgp function.","P 24894","Open Access","-0.0188","0.2631","1","Resistance protein, Positron emission tomography, Article","Resistance protein, Positron emission tomography, Article",NA,NA,"32","",""

The tracers were designed to undergo conjugation with glutathione within the brain, and hence form the corresponding MRP1 substrate tracers in situ. 6-Bromo-7-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)purine showed good brain uptake and rapid metabolic conversion.

Changes in the function and density of these proteins, in particular P-gp, may play a role in several neurological disorders. Several radioligands have been developed for measuring P-gp function at the blood–brain barrier of human subjects with positron emission tomography (PET). However, attempts to measure P-gp density with radiolabeled inhibitors that bind to these proteins in vivo have not thus far provided useful, quantifiable PET signals. Herein, we argue that not only the low density of transporters in the brain as a whole but also their very high density in brain capillaries act to lower the concentration of ligand in the plasma and thereby contribute to absent or low signals in PET studies of P-gp density. Our calculations, based on published data and theoretical approximations, estimate that whole brain densities of many efflux transporters at the blood–brain barrier range from 0.04 to 5.19 nM. We conclude that the moderate affinities (>5 nM) of currently labeled inhibitors may not allow measurement of efflux transporter density at the blood–brain barrier, and inhibitors with substantially higher affinity will be needed for density imaging of P-gp and other blood–brain barrier transporters.","1Z01MH002852-01","Open Access","-0.1056","-0.0512","8","Cns efflux drug, Altered gaba, Barrier transport","Cns efflux drug, Altered gaba, Barrier transport","2","24","13","",""

The prevalence of AD increases with aging, and women have a higher predisposition to both AD and affective disorders than men. This study aimed to investigate sex and age effects on 5-HT4 receptor-binding potentials in striatum, the limbic system, and neocortex. Positron-emission tomographic scans were conducted using the radioligand [11C]SB207145 in a cohort of 30 healthy subjects (mean age 44 years; range 20 to 86 years; 14 men and 16 women). The output parameter, BPND, was modeled using the simplified reference tissue model, and partial volume correction was performed with the Muller–Gartner method. A decline with age of 1% per decade was found only in striatum. Women had a 13% lower 5-HT4 receptor binding in the limbic system. The lower limbic 5-HT4 receptor binding in women supports a role for 5-HT4 receptors in the sex-specific differences in emotional control and might contribute to the higher prevalence of affective diseases and AD in women. The relatively stable 5-HT4 receptor binding with aging contrasts others in subtypes of receptors, which generally decrease with aging.","201380","Open Access","0.6987","-0.0195","12","Glycoprotein function, Human blood brain, Pet study","Glycoprotein function, Human blood brain, Pet study",NA,NA,"26","",""

We found that [11C]tariquidar brain uptake increased dose dependently after administration of escalating doses of Ko143, both in Mdr1a/b(−/−) mice and in tariquidar pretreated wild-type mice. After 15 mg/kg Ko143, the maximum increase in [11C]tariquidar brain uptake relative to baseline scans was 6.3-fold in Mdr1a/b(−/−) mice with a half-maximum effect dose of 4.98 mg/kg and 3.6-fold in tariquidar (8 mg/kg) pretreated wild-type mice, suggesting that the presented protocol is sensitive to visualize a range of different functional Bcrp activities at the murine BBB.

Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from start until 24 h after end of infusion (AUC0-n) was positively correlated with administered TQD dose (r=0.8981, p<0.0001). Moreover, we found a positive correlation for volume of distribution at steady state Vss (r=0.7129, p=0.0004) with TQD dose. Dose dependency of Vss points to non-linear PK of TQD, which was in all likelihood caused by transporter saturation at high TQD doses. Acceptable safety and tolerability and dose-linear increases in plasma exposure support future use of TQD at doses up to 8 mg/kg to inhibit Pgp at the human BBB.","201380","Open Access","-0.6704","0.2685","5","Abcb single, Affect transport, Amplification system","Abcb single, Affect transport, Amplification system",NA,NA,"13","",""

This study aimed to assess whether [11C]flumazenil is a P-glycoprotein substrate in humans and to what extent increased P-glycoprotein function in epilepsy may confound interpretation of clinical [11C]flumazenil studies used to assess gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptors. Nine drug-resistant patients with epilepsy and mesial temporal sclerosis were scanned twice using [11C]flumazenil before and after partial P-glycoprotein blockade with tariquidar. Volume of distribution, nondisplaceable binding potential, and the ratio of rate constants of [11C]flumazenil transport across the blood?brain barrier (K1/k2) were derived for whole brain and several regions. All parameters were compared between pre- and post-tariquidar scans. Regional results were compared between mesial temporal sclerosis and contralateral sides. Tariquidar significantly increased global K1/k2 (+23%) and volume of distribution (+10%), but not nondisplaceable binding potential. At the mesial temporal sclerosis side volume of distribution and nondisplaceable binding potential were lower in hippocampus (both ??19%) and amygdala (both ??16%), but K1/k2 did not differ, suggesting that only regional gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor density is altered in epilepsy. In conclusion, although [11C]flumazenil appears to be a (weak) P-glycoprotein substrate in humans, this does not seem to affect its role as a tracer for assessing gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor density.","201380","Open Access","-0.032","-0.2096","11","Temporal lobe epilepsy, Anticonvulsant effect, Case control","Temporal lobe epilepsy, Anticonvulsant effect, Case control",NA,NA,"0","",""

Positron emission tomography using the Pgp substrate tracer (R)-[11C]verapamil enables in vivo quantification of Pgp function at the human blood-brain barrier. Knowledge of test-retest variability is important for assessing changes over time or after treatment with disease-modifying drugs. The purpose of this study was to assess reproducibility of several tracer kinetic models used for analysis of (R)-[11C]verapamil data. Methods Dynamic (R)-[11C]verapamil scans with arterial sampling were performed twice on the same day in 13 healthy controls. Data were reconstructed using both filtered back projection [FBP] and partial volume corrected ordered subset expectation maximization [PVC OSEM]. All data were analysed using single-tissue and two-tissue compartment models. Global and regional test-retest variability was determined for various outcome measures. Results Analysis using the Akaike information criterion showed that a constrained two-tissue compartment model provided the best fits to the data. Global test-retest variability of the volume of distribution was comparable for single-tissue (6%) and constrained two-tissue (9%) compartment models. Using a single-tissue compartment model covering the first 10 min of data yielded acceptable global test-retest variability (9%) for the outcome measure K1. Test-retest variability of binding potential derived from the constrained two-tissue compartment model was less robust, but still acceptable (22%). Test-retest variability was comparable for PVC OSEM and FBP reconstructed data. Conclusion The model of choice for analysing (R)-[11C]verapamil data is a constrained two-tissue compartment model.

Enhanced P-glycoprotein (P-gp) activity has been reported in epilepsy and this may confound interpretation of clinical scans if [11C]flumazenil is a P-gp substrate. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether [11C]flumazenil is a P-gp substrate. Methods [11C]Flumazenil PET scans were performed in wild type (WT) (n = 9) and Mdr1a/1b, (the genes that encode for P-gp) double knockout (dKO) (n = 10) mice, and in naive rats (n = 10). In parallel to PET scanning, [11C]flumazenil plasma concentrations were measured in rats. For 6 of the WT and 6 of the dKO mice a second, [11C]flumazenil scan was acquired after administration of the P-gp inhibitor tariquidar. Cerebral [11C]flumazenil concentrations in WT and Mdr1a/1b dKO mice were compared (genetic disruption model). Furthermore, pre and post P-gp-blocking cerebral [11C]flumazenil concentrations were compared in all animals (pharmacological inhibition model). Results Mdr1a/1b dKO mice had approximately 70% higher [11C]flumazenil uptake in the brain than WT mice. After administration of tariquidar, cerebral [11C]flumazenil uptake in WT mice increased by about 80% in WT mice, while it remained the same in Mdr1a/1b dKO mice. In rats, cerebral [11C]flumazenil uptake increased by about 60% after tariquidar administration. Tariquidar had only a small effect on plasma clearance of flumazenil. Conclusions The present study showed that [11C]flumazenil is a P-gp substrate in rodents. Consequently, altered cerebral [11C]flumazenil uptake, as observed in epilepsy, may not reflect solely GABAA receptor density changes but also changes in P-gp activity.","201380","Open Access","0.3365","0.1156","11","Temporal lobe epilepsy, Anticonvulsant effect, Case control","Temporal lobe epilepsy, Anticonvulsant effect, Case control",NA,NA,"9","",""

P-glycoprotein is encoded by the highly polymorphic ABCB1 gene. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the ABCB1 gene have been associated with altered P-glycoprotein expression and function. P-glycoprotein function at the blood-brain barrier can be quantified in vivo using the P-glycoprotein substrate tracer (R)-[11C]verapamil and positron emission tomography (PET). The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of C1236T, G2677T/A and C3435T single-nucleotide polymorphisms in ABCB1 on blood-brain barrier P-glycoprotein function in healthy subjects and patients with Alzheimer's disease. Methods: Thirty-two healthy subjects and seventeen patients with Alzheimer's disease underwent 60-min dynamic (R)-[11C]verapamil PET scans. The binding potential of (R)-[11C]verapamil was assessed using a previously validated constrained two-tissue plasma input compartment model and used as outcome measure. DNA was isolated from frozen blood samples and C1236T, G2677T/A and C3435T single-nucleotide polymorphisms were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Results: In healthy controls, binding potential did not differ between subjects without and with one or more T present in C1236T, G2677T and C3435T. In contrast, patients with Alzheimer's disease with one or more T in C1236T, G2677T and C3435T had significantly higher binding potential values than patients without a T. In addition, there was a relationship between binding potential and T dose in C1236T and G2677T. Conclusions: In Alzheimer's disease patients, C1236T, G2677T/A and C3435T single-nucleotide polymorphisms may be related to changes in P-glycoprotein function at the blood-brain barrier. As such, genetic variations in ABCB1 might contribute to the progression of amyloid-beta deposition in the brain.","201380","Open Access","-0.2679","-0.0368","14","Alzheimer s disease, Barrier p glycoprotein, Disease patients","Alzheimer s disease, Barrier p glycoprotein, Disease patients",NA,"32","19","",""

METHODS: Data obtained from a preclinical and clinical study, in which paired (R)-[11C]verapamil PET scans were performed before, during, and after tariquidar administration, were analyzed using nonlinear mixed effects (NLME) modeling. Administration of tariquidar was included as a covariate on the influx and efflux parameters (Qin and Qout) in order to investigate if tariquidar increased influx or decreased outflux of radiotracer across the blood--brain barrier (BBB). Additionally, the influence of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) was tested on all model parameters, and the brain-to-plasma partition coefficient (VT-NLME) was calculated. RESULTS: Our model indicated that tariquidar enhances brain uptake of (R)-[11C]verapamil by decreasing Qout. The reduction in Qout in rats during and immediately after tariquidar administration (sevenfold) was more pronounced than in the second PET scan acquired 2 h after tariquidar administration (fivefold). The effect of tariquidar on Qout in humans was apparent during and immediately after tariquidar administration (twofold reduction in Qout) but was negligible in the second PET scan. SE was found to influence the pharmacological volume of distribution of the central brain compartment Vbr1. Tariquidar treatment lead to an increase in VT-NLME, and pilocarpine-induced SE lead to increased (R)-[11C]verapamil distribution to the peripheral brain compartment. CONCLUSIONS: Using NLME modeling, we were able to provide mechanistic insight into the effects of tariquidar and SE on (R)-[11C]verapamil transport across the BBB in control and 48 h post SE rats as well as in humans.

In this study, a blood sampling system was developed and tested using different radiotracers in rats. Methods The detector consists of pairs of lutetium yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) detectors, photomultiplier tubes and lead shield assembled within a steel casing working in coincidence mode. Rats were cannulated with microtubes in the femoral artery and vein for arterial blood sampling as well as administration of the PET tracers. Connected PTFE microtubes were centred between the LYSO crystals using a special holder. To enhance sensitivity, three layers with two coils were used. A flexible tube pump was used to ensure a constant blood flow. Performance of the detector was assessed with [18F]fludeoxyglucose (FDG), [18F]ciprofloxacin, (R)-[11C]verapamil, [11C]tariquidar, [11C]mephobarbital and [11C]MC113. Obtained input function curves were compared with manual samples drawn every 5?s during the first 3?min and further on at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60?min after radiotracer injection. After manual sampling, an arterio/venous shunt was established. Shape and area-under-the-curve (AUC; Bq/?l*h) of the input functions were evaluated. Results The developed detector system provided an absolute sensitivity of 6.5%. Maximum peak values agreed well between manual samples and the detector with a mean difference of ?0.4%???7.0% (max 12.0%, min ?9.9%). AUC values also exhibited an excellent correlation (R?=?0.996) between manual sampling and detector measurements with a mean difference of 9.3%???9.7% (max 24.1%, min ?3.2%). The system was able to measure peak blood activity concentration levels of 110 to 2,000?Bq/?l which corresponds to injected activities from 5.5 to 100?MBq depending on the used radiotracer, applied volume and weight of the animal. Conclusions This study demonstrates that the developed blood sampling system can be used for in vivo small animal PET studies in rats in a reliable way. The usage of the systems enhances the accuracy of the input curve as handling of small blood samples especially with low activity (as for C-11) is prone to measurement errors. Additionally, the radiation dose of the experimenters can be reduced, as it is not required anymore to continuously draw samples where the personal is in close contact to the radioactive animals and blood.","201380","Open Access","0.5499","0.4081","5","Abcb single, Affect transport, Amplification system","Abcb single, Affect transport, Amplification system",NA,NA,"3","",""

Rats were infused with 10 or 20 mg/kg quinidine over 30 min or 4 h. Plasma, brain extracellular fluid (brain ECF), and end-of-experiment total brain concentrations of quinidine were determined during 7 h after the start of the infusion. Effect of pretreatment with tariquidar (15 mg/kg, administered 30 min before the start of the quinidine infusion) on the brain distribution of quinidine was assessed. This approach was repeated in kainate-treated rats. Quinidine kinetics were analyzed with population modeling (NONMEM). The quinidine microdialysis assay clearly revealed differences in brain distribution upon changes in P-glycoprotein functionality by pre-administration of tariquidar, which resulted in a 7.2-fold increase in brain ECF and a 40-fold increase in total brain quinidine concentration. After kainate treatment alone, however, no difference in quinidine transport across the blood–brain barrier was found, but kainate-treated rats tended to have a lower total brain concentration but a higher brain ECF concentration of quinidine than saline-treated rats. This study did not provide evidence for the hypothesis that P-glycoprotein function at the blood–brain barrier is altered at 1 week after SE induction, but rather suggests that P-glycoprotein function might be altered at the brain parenchymal level.","201380","Open Access","0.3363","0.3065","12","Glycoprotein function, Human blood brain, Pet study","Glycoprotein function, Human blood brain, Pet study",NA,NA,"12","",""

Conclusions: The data from our pilot study suggest that Pgp overactivity in epilepsy is dynamic, and complete seizure control and elimination of antiepileptic medication is associated with reversal of overactivity, although these findings will require confirmation in a larger patient cohort.","unidentified","Open Access","0.2049","-0.2237","11","Temporal lobe epilepsy, Anticonvulsant effect, Case control","Temporal lobe epilepsy, Anticonvulsant effect, Case control","5","30","17","",""

METHODS: In a retrospective, cross-sectional study, we identified patients from our clinical database of verbal fluency fMRI studies who were treated with either TPM (n = 32) or ZNS (n = 51). We matched 62 patients for clinical measures who took LEV but not TPM or ZNS. We entered antiepileptic comedications as nuisance variables and compared out-of-scanner psychometric measures for verbal fluency and working memory between groups. RESULTS: Out-of-scanner psychometric data showed overall poorer performance for TPM compared to ZNS and LEV and poorer working memory performance in ZNS-treated patients compared to LEV-treated patients. We found common fMRI effects in patients taking ZNS and TPM, with decreased activations in cognitive frontal and parietal lobe networks compared to those taking LEV. Impaired deactivation was seen only with TPM. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that TPM and ZNS are associated with similar dysfunctions of frontal and parietal cognitive networks, which are associated with impaired performance. TPM is also associated with impaired attenuation of language-associated deactivation. These studies imply medication-specific effects on the functional neuroanatomy of language and working memory networks. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that in patients with focal epilepsy, TPM and ZNS compared to LEV lead to disruption of language and working memory networks.","106882","Open Access","0.7555","0.1233","6","Attenuation correction, Scatter correction","Attenuation correction, Scatter correction","47","17","7","",""

W.","2012-04-01","Public Library of Science","publication","","PLoS ONE","","16p13.11 genomic copy number variants are implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, autism, mental retardation, ADHD and epilepsy. The mechanisms leading to the diverse clinical manifestations of deletions and duplications at this locus are unknown. Most studies favour NDE1 as the leading disease-causing candidate gene at 16p13.11. In epilepsy at least, the deletion does not appear to unmask recessive-acting mutations in NDE1, with haploinsufficiency and genetic modifiers being prime candidate disease mechanisms. NDE1 encodes a protein critical to cell positioning during cortical development. As a first step, it is important to determine whether 16p13.11 copy number change translates to detectable brain structural alteration. We undertook detailed neuropathology on surgically resected brain tissue of two patients with intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), who had the same heterozygous NDE1-containing 800 kb 16p13.11 deletion, using routine histological stains and immunohistochemical markers against a range of layer-specific, white matter, neural precursor and migratory cell proteins, and NDE1 itself. Surgical temporal lobectomy samples from a MTLE case known not to have a deletion in NDE1 and three non-epilepsy cases were included as disease controls. We found that apart from a 3 mm hamartia in the temporal cortex of one MTLE case with NDE1 deletion and known hippocampal sclerosis in the other case, cortical lamination and cytoarchitecture were normal, with no differences between cases with deletion and disease controls. How 16p13.11 copy changes lead to a variety of brain diseases remains unclear, but at least in epilepsy, it would not seem to be through structural abnormality or dyslamination as judged by microscopy or immunohistochemistry. The need to integrate additional data with genetic findings to determine their significance will become more pressing as genetic technologies generate increasingly rich datasets. Detailed examination of brain tissue, where available, will be an important part of this process in neurogenetic disease specifically.","201380","Open Access","0.6504","-0.2463","5","Abcb single, Affect transport, Amplification system","Abcb single, Affect transport, Amplification system",NA,"38","6","",""

The drug transporter hypothesis for refractory epilepsy proposes that P-gp is over expressed at the epileptic focus with a role of P-gp in extruding AEDs from the brain. However, there is controversy regarding whether all AEDs are substrates for this transporter. Our aim was to investigate transport of phenytoin, lamotrigine and carbamazepine by using seven in-vitro transport models. Uptake assays in CEM/VBL cell lines, oocytes expressing human P-gp and an immortalised human brain endothelial cell line (hCMEC/D3) were carried out. Concentration equilibrium transport assays were performed in Caco-2, MDCKII ?P-gp and LLC-PK1?P-gp in the absence or presence of tariquidar, an inhibitor of P-gp. Finally, primary porcine brain endothelial cells were used to determine the apparent permeability (Papp) of the three AEDs in the absence or presence of P-gp inhibitors. We detected weak transport of phenytoin in two of the transport systems (MDCK and LLC-PK1 cells transfected with human P-gp) but not in the remaining five. No P-gp interaction was observed for lamotrigine or carbamazepine in any of the seven validated in-vitro transport models. Neither lamotrigine nor carbamazepine was a substrate for P-gp in any of the model systems tested. Our data suggest that P-gp is unlikely to contribute to the pathogenesis of refractory epilepsy through transport of carbamazepine or lamotrigine.","unidentified","Open Access","0.1645","-0.3484","8","Cns efflux drug, Altered gaba, Barrier transport","Cns efflux drug, Altered gaba, Barrier transport",NA,"22","14","",""

First, the use of compartment models, and their interpretation in terms of P-gp function at the blood-brain barrier, is discussed. Then, the methods that have been used to quantify PET data of the P-gp tracers [11C]verapamil, [11C]N-desmetyl-loperamide (dLop), [11C]laniquidar, [11C]phenytoin, [11C]tariquidar and [11C]elacridar are reviewed.

Changes in ABC transporter expression and function are thought to be implicated in various diseases, such as cancer, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. The availability of a non-invasive imaging method which allows for measuring ABC transporter function or expression in vivo would be of great clinical use in that it could facilitate the identification of those patients that would benefit from treatment with ABC transporter modulating drugs. To date three different kinds of imaging probes have been described to measure ABC transporters in vivo: i) radiolabelled transporter substrates ii) radiolabelled transporter inhibitors and iii) radiolabelled prodrugs which are enzymatically converted into transporter substrates in the organ of interest (e.g. brain). The design of new imaging probes to visualize efflux transporters is inter alia complicated by the overlapping substrate recognition pattern of different ABC transporter types. The present article will describe currently available ABC transporter radiotracers for positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and critically discuss strengths and limitations of individual probes and their potential clinical applications.","201380","Open Access","-0.1827","-0.2714","8","Cns efflux drug, Altered gaba, Barrier transport","Cns efflux drug, Altered gaba, Barrier transport",NA,NA,"39","",""

Of these, the so-called transporter hypothesis is the most extensively researched and documented. This hypothesis assumes that refractory epilepsy is associated with a localised over-expression of drug transporter proteins such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp) in the region of the epileptic focus, which actively extrudes antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) from their intended site of action. However, although this hypothesis has biological plausibility, there is no clinical evidence to support the assertion that AEDs are sufficiently strong substrates for transporter-mediated extrusion from the brain. The use of modern brain imaging techniques to determine Pgp function in patients with refractory epilepsy has started only recently, and may ultimately determine whether increased expression and function of Pgp or other efflux transporters are involved in AED resistance.","201380","Open Access","0.0599","-0.3791","8","Cns efflux drug, Altered gaba, Barrier transport","Cns efflux drug, Altered gaba, Barrier transport",NA,NA,"19","",""

However, distillation of [18F]FEA is typically required, which is time-consuming and unpractical for routine applications. In addition, copper(I)-catalyzed cycloaddition of [18F]FEA with non-activated alkynes, and with substrates containing labile functional groups, can be challenging. Herein, we report a highly efficient and practical ligand-accelerated one-pot/two-step method for ‘click’ labeling of small molecule tracers with [18F]FEA. The method exploits the ability of the copper(I) ligand bathophenanthrolinedisulfonate to accelerate the rate of the cycloaddition reaction. As a result, alkynes can be added directly to the crude reaction mixture containing [18F]FEA, and as cyclisation occurs almost immediately at room temperature, the reaction is tolerant to labile functional groups. The method was demonstrated by reacting [18F]FEA with a series of alkyne-functionalized 6-halopurines to give the corresponding triazoles in 55–76% analytical radiochemical yield.","201380","Open Access","0.525","0.5798","5","Abcb single, Affect transport, Amplification system","Abcb single, Affect transport, Amplification system",NA,NA,"7","",""
