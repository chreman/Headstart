			Forty three microsatellite markers were developed for further genetic characterisation of a forage and biomass grass crop, for which genomic resources are currently scarce. The microsatellite markers were developed from a normalized EST-SSR library. All of the 43 markers gave a clear banding pattern on 3 % Metaphor agarose gels. Eight selected SSR markers were tested in detail for polymorphism across eleven DNA samples of large geographic distribution across Europe. The new set of 43 SSR markers will help future research to characterise the genetic structure and diversity of Phalaris arundinacea, with a potential to further understand its invasive character in North American wetlands, as well as aid in breeding work for desired biomass and forage traits. P. arundinacea is particularly valued in the northern latitude as a crop with high biomass potential, even more so on marginal lands.

Despite its economic importance, it is lacking in public genomic data. We explore comparative exomics of the grass cultivars in the context of response to salt exposure. The limited data set poses challenges to the computational pipeline. Methods As a prerequisite for the comparative study, we generate the Phalaris reference transcriptome sequence, one of the first steps in addressing the issue of paucity of processed genomic data in this species. In addition, the differential expression (DE) and active-but-stable genes for salt stress conditions were analyzed by a novel method that was experimentally verified on human RNA-seq data. For the comparative exomics, we focus on the DE and stable genic regions, with respect to salt stress, of the genome. Results and conclusions In our comparative study, we find that phylogeny of the DE and stable genic regions of the Phalaris cultivars are distinct. At the same time we find the phylogeny of the entire expressed reference transcriptome matches the phylogeny of only the stable genes. Thus the behavior of the different cultivars is distinguished by the salt stress response. This is also reflected in the genomic distinctions in the DE genic regions. These observations have important implications in the choice of cultivars, and their breeding, for bio-energy fuels. Further, we identified genes that are representative of DE under salt stress and could provide vital clues in our understanding of the stress handling mechanisms in general.","BMC Genomics","English","BioMed Central","2014-10-01","10.1186/1471-2164-15-S6-S18","publication","0.3226","0.458","1","Salt stress","Salt stress","",""

Genotypic differences in miscanthus were investigated to identify genotypes with a high cold tolerance at low temperatures and quick recovery upon rising temperatures to enable them to exploit the early growing season in maritime cold climates. Suitable methods for field screening of cold tolerance in miscanthus were also identified. Methods Fourteen genotypes of M. sacchariflorus, M. sinensis, M. tinctorius and M. ? giganteus were selected and grown under warm (24??C) and cold (14??C) conditions in a controlled environment. Dark-adapted chlorophyll fluorescence, specific leaf area (SLA) and net photosynthetic rate at a photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) of 1000??mol m?2 s?1 (A 1000) were measured. Photosynthetic light and CO2 response curves were obtained from 11 of the genotypes, and shoot growth rate was measured under field conditions. Key Results A positive linear relationship was found between SLA and light-saturated photosynthesis (A sat) across genotypes, and also between shoot growth rate under cool field conditions and A 1000 at 14??C in a climate chamber. When lowering the temperature from 24 to 14??C, one M. sacchariflorus exhibited significantly higher A sat and maximum photosynthetic rate in the CO2 response curve (V max) than other genotypes at 14??C, except M. ? giganteus ?Hornum?. Several genotypes returned to their pre-chilling A 1000 values when the temperature was increased to 24??C after 24 d growth at 14??C. Conclusions One M. sacchariflorus genotype had similar or higher photosynthetic capacity than M. ? giganteus, and may be used for cultivation together with M. ? giganteus or for breeding new interspecies hybrids with improved traits for temperate climates. Two easily measured variables, SLA and shoot growth rate, may be useful for genotype screening of productivity and cold tolerance.","Annals of Botany","English","Oxford University Press","2016-05-01","10.1093/aob/mcw042","publication","-0.4884","0.3039","2","Canopy architecture, Canopy photosynthesis","Canopy architecture, Canopy photosynthesis","",""
