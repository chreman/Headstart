Our current knowledge on lipid organization and cellular lipid homeostasis is mainly based on biochemical data. However, the resolving power of the most commonly used biochemical methods (molecular analysis of cellular fractions and the use of fluorescent lipid analogs) is limited. To gain further insight in subcellular lipid distribution and processes involved in cellular lipid homeostasis requires a high resolution method, allowing the study of lipids within the cellular context. In this thesis, we explored the use of one such method, transmission electron microscopy, to study cellular lipids, lipid droplets and lipoproteins at the ultrastructural level. Preparation of biological samples for electron microscopy (EM) is aimed at either immobilizing or removing water within the sample while retaining the ultrastructural organization of the cell. Based on the existing literature, lipid preservation in EM sample preparation was examined. From this, parameters determining lipid extraction were derived, allowing us to assess lipid retention in a given sample preparation procedure. This information was applied in studying approaches to visualize the biogenesis of lipid droplets (LDs). Using several preparation- and imaging techniques, we found indications that LD biogenesis occurs in the mitochondria-associated ER membranes, making critical progress in visualizing the initial stages of lipid droplet formation. Interaction between LDs and other cellular organelles was assessed by reconstructing 3d volumes from recorded tilt-series, allowing us to show direct membrane contacts between LDs and ER membrane and between an LD and a lysosome. The formation of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), the main carriers of neutral lipid in the blood circulation, was investigated. Immuno-gold labeling on ApoB, the main apo-protein on VLDL, could in principle be used to study the synthesis route of VLDL. However, the current 'on-section’-labeling strategies often suffer from a loss of antigenicity of ApoB. We show that this is most likely due to delipidation of ApoB by the lipid scavenging action of bovine serum albumin, used as a blocking agent during the labeling procedure. By reducing de-lipidation, we are able to successfully localize ApoB by immuno-gold labeling. We were able to trace the flow of de-novo synthesized cellular lipid at the ultrastructural level, using a clickable fatty acid, combined with an optimized specimen preparation procedure. This lipid flow could be changed and re-directed using specific inhibitors. Changes were visualized within the cell by immuno-gold labeling, validating the use of clickable fatty acids as a suitable tool for imaging lipid flows on the nanometer scale. Lastly we present a novel method for high-pressure freezing and frozen hydrated sectioning of cells attached to the substrate they were grown on, providing a less artifact-prone method for frozen hydrated sectioning and cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS). This method reduces sample preparation time, allows the use of shorter incubation times and brings electron microscopy one step closer to the ultimate goal: visualizing cells in their native state at high resolution.","202272","Open Access","0.4369","0.1234","7","Lipid droplets, Caveolin deficient, Affects lxr","Lipid droplets, Caveolin deficient, Affects lxr",NA,NA,NA,"",""

However, only a part of the obese population develops secondary metabolic disorders. Here, we identify the transcription factor retinoid-related orphan receptor gamma (RORγ) as a negative regulator of adipocyte differentiation through expression of its newly identified target gene matrix metalloproteinase 3. In vivo differentiation of adipocyte progenitor cells from Rorγ-deficient mice is enhanced and obese Rorγ−/− mice show decreased adipocyte sizes. These small adipocytes are highly insulin sensitive, leading to an improved control of circulating free fatty acids. Ultimately, Rorγ−/− mice are protected from hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in the state of obesity. In adipose stromal-vascular fraction from obese human subjects, Rorγ expression is correlated with adipocyte size and negatively correlated with adipogenesis and insulin sensitivity. Taken together, our findings identify RORγ as a factor, which controls adipogenesis as well as adipocyte size and modulates insulin sensitivity in obesity. RORγ might therefore serve as a novel pharmaceutical target to treat obesity-associated insulin resistance.","202272","Open Access","-0.3594","0.0699","12","High fat diet, Diet induced obesity, Obesity and insulin","High fat diet, Diet induced obesity, Obesity and insulin",45,"42","1","",""

Recently, the closure of IPI in September 2011 was announced. Its recommended replacement is the new UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) ?complete proteome? sets, launched in May 2011. Here, we analyze the consequences of IPI's discontinuation for human and mouse data, and the effect of its substitution with UniProtKB on two levels: (i) data already produced and (ii) newly performed experiments. To estimate the effect on existing data, we investigated how well IPI identifiers map to UniProtKB accessions. We found that 21% of human and 10% of mouse identifiers do not map to UniProtKB and would thus be ?lost.? To investigate the impact on new experiments, we compared the theoretical search space (i.e. the tryptic peptides) of both resources and found that it is decreased by 14.0% for human and 8.9% for mouse data through IPI's closure. An analysis on the experimental evidence for these ?lost? peptides showed that the vast majority has not been identified in experiments available in the major proteomics repositories. It thus seems likely that the search space provided by UniProtKB is of higher quality than the one currently provided by IPI.","085949","Open Access","-0.5892","-0.2422","6","Osbp related protein, Caveolae field, Cavin proteins","Osbp related protein, Caveolae field, Cavin proteins",20,"36","6","",""

Prompted by this initial finding, we carried out association analysis in a metabolic syndrome subcohort (Genmets) of Health2000 examination survey (N?=?2,138), revealing association of multiple OSBPL10 SNPs with high serum TG levels (>95th percentile). To investigate whether OSBPL10 could be the gene underlying the observed linkage and association, we carried out functional experiments in the human hepatoma cell line Huh7. Silencing of OSBPL10 increased the incorporation of [3H]acetate into cholesterol and both [3H]acetate and [3H]oleate into triglycerides and enhanced the accumulation of secreted apolipoprotein B100 in growth medium, suggesting that the encoded protein ORP10 suppresses hepatic lipogenesis and very-low-density lipoprotein production. ORP10 was shown to associate dynamically with microtubules, consistent with its involvement in intracellular transport or organelle positioning. The data introduces OSBPL10 as a gene whose variation may contribute to high triglyceride levels in dyslipidemic Finnish subjects and provides evidence for ORP10 as a regulator of cellular lipid metabolism.

Multiple isoforms of apo(a) exist that are genetically determined by differences in the number of Kringle-IV type-2 repeats encoded by the LPA gene. Elevated plasma Lp(a) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The phenotypic diversity of familial Lp(a) hyperlipidemia [Lp(a)-HLP] and familial hypercholesterolemia [FH], as defined risks with genetic background, and their frequent co-incidence with additional cardiovascular risk factors require a critical revision of the current diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations established for isolated familial Lp(a)-HLP or FH in combination with elevated Lp(a) levels. Lp(a) assays still suffer from poor standardization, comparability and particle variation. Further evaluation of the current biomarkers and establishment of novel comorbidity biomarkers are necessary for extended risk assessment of cardiovascular disease in FH or Lp(a)-HLP and to better understand the pathophysiology and to improve patient stratification of the Lp(a) syndrome complex. Lp(a) promotes vascular remodeling, increased lesion progression and intima media thickening through induction of M1-macrophages, antiangiogenic effects (e.g. vasa vasorum) with secretion of the antiangiogenic chemokine CXCL10 (IP10) and CXCR3 mediated activation of Th1- and NK-cells. In addition inhibition of serine proteases causing disturbances of thrombosis/ hemostasis/ fibrinolysis, TGFb-activation and acute phase response (e.g. CRP, anti-PL antibodies) are major features of Lp(a) pathology.

The goal of our study was to analyze a potential synergism between ox-PAPC and IL-15 in the in vitro model of angiogenesis carried out in the human endothelial cells (HUVECs). Increasing IL-15 concentrations led to formation of the tube-like structures in the matrigel 3D-model of angiogenesis (P < 0.05), in contrast to ox-PAPC that inhibited this process. HUVECs incubation with ox-PAPC led to reduced IL-15 gene basal expression (P = 0.033) along with parallel increase, however statistically insignificant, of basal gene expression of IL-8 (P = 0.086). Our findings point to the ox-PAPC opposite effects on the IL-8- and IL-15-mediated angiogenic responses that contribute to pathological angiogenesis induced by ox-LDL.","202272","Open Access","0.0615","-0.6319","4","Hepatitis c virus, And signaling, Anti apoptotic","Hepatitis c virus, And signaling, Anti apoptotic",3,NA,NA,"",""

The aim of our study was to analyze Cx43 gene expression, Cx43 protein localization and mitochondrial function in the human endothelial cells stressed by dietary-free fatty acids (FFA) and TNFα. Human endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated with (10–30 uM) palmitic (PA), oleic (OA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA) or arachidonic (AA) acids for 24 h. TNFα (5 ng/ml) was added at the last 4 h of incubation. The Cx43 gene expression was analyzed by the quantitative real-time PCR. The Cx43 protein concentrations in whole cells and in the isolated mitochondria were measured. Changes in ∆ψ and Cx43 localization were analyzed by flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy. Generated ATP was measured by a luminescence assay. TNFα, PA and OA significantly decreased ∆ψ, while AA (P = 0.047) and EPA (P = 0.004) increased ∆ψ value. Preincubation with EPA or AA partially prevented the TNFα-induced decrease of ∆ψ. Incubation with AA resulted in up-regulation of the Cx43 gene expression. AA or PA significantly increased Cx43 protein content; however, presence of TNFα in general aggravated the negative effect of FFA. Only EPA was found to increase ATP generation in HUVECs. The fatty acid-specific induction of changes in Cx43 expression and protein concentration as well as the normalization of ∆ψ and increase of ATP generation seem to be the separate, independent mechanisms of FFA-mediated modulatory effect in the human endothelial cells pathology.","202272","Open Access","0.0085","-0.4171","4","Hepatitis c virus, And signaling, Anti apoptotic","Hepatitis c virus, And signaling, Anti apoptotic",6,NA,NA,"",""

As CD36-deficiency attenuates the development of high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, the role of CD36-deficiency in preadipocyte recruitment and adipocyte function was set out to characterize. Design and methods: Fat cell size and number were determined in gonadal, visceral, and subcutaneous adipose tissue of CD36(-/-) and WT mice after 6 weeks on HFD. Basal lipolysis and insulin-inhibited lipolysis were investigated in gonadal adipose tissue. Results: CD36(-/-) mice showed a reduction in adipocyte size in all fat pads. Gonadal adipose tissue also showed a lower total number of adipocytes because of a lower number of very small adipocytes (diameter <50 μm). This was accompanied by an increased pool of preadipocytes, which suggests that CD36-deficiency reduces the capacity of preadipocytes to become adipocytes. Regarding lipolysis, in adipose tissue from CD36(-/-) mice, cAMP levels were increased and both basal and 8-bromo-cAMP stimulated lipolysis were higher. However, insulin-mediated inhibition of lipolysis was more potent in CD36(-/-) mice. Conclusions: These results indicate that during fat depot expansion, CD36-deficiency negatively affects preadipocyte recruitment and that in mature adipocytes, CD36-deficiency is associated with increased basal lipolysis and insulin responsiveness.","202272","Open Access","-0.3493","0.1362","8","Human adipose tissue, Metabolism, Article","Human adipose tissue, Metabolism, Article",8,"15","1","",""

			        Nuclear receptors (NRs) are important pharmacological targets for a number of diseases, including cancer and metabolic disorders. To unmask the direct role of NR function it is fundamental to find the NR targets. During the last few years several NRs have been shown to affect microRNA expression, thereby modulating protein levels. The farnesoid X receptor (FXR), the main regulator of bile acid (BA) homeostasis, also regulates cholesterol, lipid and glucose metabolism. Here we used, for the first time, a proteomics approach on mice treated with a FXR ligand to find novel hepatic FXR targets. Nineteen spots with a more than two-fold difference in protein amounts were found by 2D-DIGE and 20 proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF MS as putative novel FXR targets. The most striking feature of the protein list was the great number of mitochondrial proteins, indicating a substantial impact of FXR activation on mitochondrial function in the liver. To examine if the differences found in the proteomics assay reflected differences at the mRNA level, a microarray assay was generated on hepatic samples from wild type and FXR?/? mice treated with a FXR ligand and compared to vehicle treatment. At least six proteins were shown to be regulated only at a post-transcriptional level. In conclusion, our study provides the impetus to include proteomic analysis for the identification of novel targets of transcription factors, such as NRs.
			Abstract

Various intracellular pathogens, including viruses, bacteria and parasites, specifically target host lipid droplets during their life cycle. Viruses such as hepatitis C virus, dengue virus and rotaviruses use lipid droplets as platforms for assembly. Bacteria, such as mycobacteria and chlamydia, and parasites, such as trypanosomes, use host lipid droplets for nutritional purposes.

Despite its high clinical relevance, the molecular function of ADPN and the mechanism by which I148M variant affects hepatic metabolism are unclear. Here we show that ADPN promotes cellular lipid synthesis by converting lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) into phosphatidic acid. The ADPN-catalyzed LPA acyltransferase (LPAAT) reaction is specific for LPA and long-chain acyl-CoAs. Wild-type mice receiving a high-sucrose diet exhibit substantial upregulation of Adpn in the liver and a concomitant increase in LPAAT activity. In Adpn-deficient mice, this diet-induced increase in hepatic LPAAT activity is reduced. Notably, the I148M variant of human ADPN exhibits increased LPAAT activity leading to increased cellular lipid accumulation. This gain of function provides a plausible biochemical mechanism for the development of liver steatosis in subjects carrying the I148M variant.","202272","Open Access","-0.0511","0.0966","4","Hepatitis c virus, And signaling, Anti apoptotic","Hepatitis c virus, And signaling, Anti apoptotic",121,NA,NA,"",""

Methods: Weight gain was monitored for up to 20 wk in mice receiving a low-fat diet, an HFD, or an HFD supplemented with META060 or rosiglitazone. Body composition was determined using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometric analysis. Indirect calorimetric measurements were performed to investigate the energy balance in the mice, and oral glucose tolerance tests were administered to examine the effect of META060 on the glycemic response. Results: The HFD-fed mice administered META060 for 14 wk had a significantly lower mean weight than HFD-fed mice (30.58 ± 0.5 versus 37.88 ± 0.7 g, P < 0.05). Indirect calorimetric measurements showed an increased metabolic flexibility in mice supplemented with META060. In addition, glucose tolerance was improved, comparable to the effects of rosiglitazone treatment. Conclusions: META060 has potential therapeutic value for managing obesity and insulin resistance, and further research into the mechanism of action is warranted.","202272","Open Access","-0.4065","0.2402","12","High fat diet, Diet induced obesity, Obesity and insulin","High fat diet, Diet induced obesity, Obesity and insulin",5,NA,NA,"",""

The hydrolytic cleavage of TAG generates non-esterified fatty acids, which are subsequently used as energy substrates, essential precursors for lipid and membrane synthesis, or mediators in cell signaling processes. Consistent with its central importance in lipid and energy homeostasis, lipolysis occurs in essentially all tissues and cell types, it is most abundant, however, in white and brown adipose tissue. Over the last 5 years, important enzymes and regulatory protein factors involved in lipolysis have been identified. These include an essential TAG hydrolase named adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) [annotated as patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein A2], the ATGL activator comparative gene identification-58 [annotated as α/β hydrolase containing protein 5], and the ATGL inhibitor G0/G1 switch gene 2. Together with the established hormone-sensitive lipase [annotated as lipase E] and monoglyceride lipase, these proteins constitute the basic “lipolytic machinery”. Additionally, a large number of hormonal signaling pathways and lipid droplet-associated protein factors regulate substrate access and the activity of the “lipolysome”. This review summarizes the current knowledge concerning the enzymes and regulatory processes governing lipolysis of fat stores in adipose and non-adipose tissues. Special emphasis will be given to ATGL, its regulation, and physiological function.","201608","Open Access","0.1224","-0.1399","13","Plasma membrane, Membrane lipids, Lipid droplets","Plasma membrane, Membrane lipids, Lipid droplets",248,"357","2","",""

			        We have used targeted genomic sequencing of high-complexity DNA pools based on long-range PCR and deep DNA sequencing by the SOLiD technology. The method was used for sequencing of 286 kb from four chromosomal regions with quantitative trait loci (QTL) influencing blood plasma lipid and uric acid levels in DNA pools of 500 individuals from each of five European populations. The method shows very good precision in estimating allele frequencies as compared to individual genotyping of SNPs (r2=0.95, p<10-16). Validation shows that the method is able to identify novel SNPs and estimate their frequency in high-complexity DNA pools. In our five populations, 17% of all SNPs and 61% of structural variants are not available in the public databases. A large fraction of the novel variants show a limited geographic distribution, with 62% of the novel SNPs and 59% of novel structural variants being detected in only one of the populations. The large number of population-specific novel SNPs underscores the need for comprehensive sequencing of local populations in order to identify the causal variants of human traits.

However, the role of these enzymes in development is poorly understood due to the lack of animal models. We identified schlank as a new Drosophila member of the ceramide synthase family. We demonstrate that schlank is involved in the de novo synthesis of a broad range of ceramides, the key metabolites of sphingolipid biosynthesis. Unexpectedly, schlank mutants also show reduction of storage fat, which is deposited as triacylglyerols in the fat body. We found that schlank can positively regulate fatty acid synthesis by promoting the expression of sterol-responsive element-binding protein (SREBP) and SREBP-target genes. It further prevents lipolysis by downregulating the expression of triacylglycerol lipase. Our results identify schlank as a new regulator of the balance between lipogenesis and lipolysis in Drosophila. Furthermore, our studies of schlank and the mammalian Lass2 family member suggest a novel role for ceramide synthases in regulating body fat metabolism.","202272","Open Access","-0.229","-0.3409","8","Human adipose tissue, Metabolism, Article","Human adipose tissue, Metabolism, Article",39,NA,NA,"",""

The serine protease channel-activating protease-1 (CAP1; also termed protease serine S1 family member 8 (Prss8)) is important for epidermal homeostasis and is thus indispensable for postnatal survival in mice, but its roles and effectors in skin pathology are poorly defined. In this paper, we report that transgenic expression in mouse skin of either CAP1/Prss8 (K14-CAP1/Prss8) or protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2; Grhl3(PAR2/+)), one candidate downstream target, causes epidermal hyperplasia, ichthyosis and itching. K14-CAP1/Prss8 ectopic expression impairs epidermal barrier function and causes skin inflammation characterized by an increase in thymic stromal lymphopoietin levels and immune cell infiltrations. Strikingly, both gross and functional K14-CAP1/Prss8-induced phenotypes are completely negated when superimposed on a PAR2-null background, establishing PAR2 as a pivotal mediator of pathogenesis. Our data provide genetic evidence for PAR2 as a downstream effector of CAP1/Prss8 in a signalling cascade that may provide novel therapeutic targets for ichthyoses, pruritus and inflammatory skin diseases.","202272","Open Access","-0.4832","-0.0329","3","Bile acid receptor, Acid receptor fxr, Nuclear bile acid","Bile acid receptor, Acid receptor fxr, Nuclear bile acid",43,NA,NA,"",""

For biological activity, PPARs require cognate lipid ligands, heterodimerization with retinoic × receptors, and coactivation by PPAR-γ coactivator-1α or PPAR-γ coactivator-1β (PGC-1α or PGC-1β, encoded by Ppargc1a and Ppargc1b, respectively). Here we show that lipolysis of cellular triglycerides by adipose triglyceride lipase (patatin-like phospholipase domain containing protein 2, encoded by Pnpla2; hereafter referred to as Atgl) generates essential mediator(s) involved in the generation of lipid ligands for PPAR activation. Atgl deficiency in mice decreases mRNA levels of PPAR-α and PPAR-δ target genes. In the heart, this leads to decreased PGC-1α and PGC-1β expression and severely disrupted mitochondrial substrate oxidation and respiration; this is followed by excessive lipid accumulation, cardiac insufficiency and lethal cardiomyopathy. Reconstituting normal PPAR target gene expression by pharmacological treatment of Atgl-deficient mice with PPAR-α agonists completely reverses the mitochondrial defects, restores normal heart function and prevents premature death. These findings reveal a potential treatment for the excessive cardiac lipid accumulation and often-lethal cardiomyopathy in people with neutral lipid storage disease, a disease marked by reduced or absent ATGL activity.","202272","Open Access","0.1923","-0.0499","13","Plasma membrane, Membrane lipids, Lipid droplets","Plasma membrane, Membrane lipids, Lipid droplets",267,"182",NA,"",""

A total of 26 mRNA transcript candidates were selected from the literature.

MiR-103 was overall the most stable microRNA transcript across all biological backgrounds. Several proposed and commonly used normalization transcripts were found to be highly variable. We then tested the effect on expression of two established adipocyte-related transcripts (fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) and microRNA-145 (miR-145)), either normalized to the optimal or a commonly used controls transcript.

As renal disease in obesity can occur independently of hypertension and diabetes, other yet undefined causal pathological pathways must be present. Our study elucidate novel pathological pathways of metabolic renal injury through LDL-induced lipotoxicity and metainflammation. Our in vitro and in vivo analysis revealed a direct lipotoxic effect of metabolic overloading on tubular renal cells through a multifaceted mechanism that includes intralysosomal lipid amassing, lysosomal dysfunction, oxidative stress, and tubular dysfunction. The combination of these endogenous metabolic injuries culminated in the activation of the innate immune NLRP3 inflammasome complex. By inhibiting the sirtuin-1/LKB1/AMPK pathway, NLRP3 inflammasome dampened lipid breakdown, thereby worsening the LDL-induced intratubular phospholipid accumulation. Consequently, the presence of NLRP3 exacerbated tubular oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage and malabsorption during overnutrition. Altogether, our data demonstrate a causal link between LDL and tubular damage and the creation of a vicious cycle of excessive nutrients-NLRP3 activation-catabolism inhibition during metabolic kidney injury. Hence, this study strongly highlights the importance of renal epithelium in lipid handling and recognizes the role of NLRP3 as a central hub in metainflammation and immunometabolism in parenchymal non-immune cells.","202272","Open Access","0.2454","-0.203","5","Lipid metabolism, Metabolic syndrome, Atherogenic disease","Lipid metabolism, Metabolic syndrome, Atherogenic disease",3,"20","1","",""

Detailed lipid metabolic profiling showed that this transcriptional regulation leads to a dramatically increased fatty acid synthesis as driving force for enhanced phospholipid synthesis.

Ultrastructural analysis revealed that this transcriptional and metabolic regulation is essential for development of macrophage filopodia and cellular organelles including primary lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi network.

Here, we showed that mice deficient in Nlrp3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein, and caspase-1 were resistant to the development of high-fat diet-induced obesity, which correlated with protection from obesity-induced insulin resistance. Furthermore, hepatic triglyceride content, adipocyte size, and macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue were all reduced in mice deficient in inflammasome components. Monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 is a key molecule that mediates macrophage infiltration. Indeed, defective inflammasome activation was associated with reduced MCP-1 production in adipose tissue. Furthermore, plasma leptin and resistin that affect energy use and insulin sensitivity were also changed by inflammasome-deficiency. Detailed metabolic and molecular phenotyping demonstrated that the inflammasome controls energy expenditure and adipogenic gene expression during chronic overfeeding.

In the search for markers of metastasis and more effective therapies, the tumor metabolome is relevant because of its importance to the malignant phenotype and metastatic capacity of tumor cells. Altered choline metabolism is a hallmark of cancer. More specifically, a decreased glycerophosphocholine (GPC) to phosphocholine (PC) ratio was reported in breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers. Improved strategies to exploit this altered choline metabolism are therefore required. However, the critical enzyme cleaving GPC to produce choline, the initial step in the pathway controlling the GPC/PC ratio, remained unknown. In the present work, we have identified the enzyme, here named EDI3 (endometrial differential 3). Purified recombinant EDI3 protein cleaves GPC to form glycerol-3-phosphate and choline. Silencing EDI3 in MCF-7 cells decreased this enzymatic activity, increased the intracellular GPC/PC ratio, and decreased downstream lipid metabolites. Downregulating EDI3 activity inhibited cell migration via disruption of the PKCα signaling pathway, with stable overexpression of EDI3 showing the opposite effect. EDI3 was originally identified in our screening study comparing mRNA levels in metastasizing and nonmetastasizing endometrial carcinomas. Both Kaplan–Meier and multivariate analyses revealed a negative association between high EDI3 expression and relapse-free survival time in both endometrial (P < 0.001) and ovarian (P = 0.029) cancers. Overall, we have identified EDI3, a key enzyme controlling GPC and choline metabolism. Because inhibition of EDI3 activity corrects the GPC/PC ratio and decreases the migration capacity of tumor cells, it represents a possible target for therapeutic intervention.","202272","Open Access","0.1314","-0.4751","4","Hepatitis c virus, And signaling, Anti apoptotic","Hepatitis c virus, And signaling, Anti apoptotic",42,"49","1","",""

In this study, we present a live cell single molecule approach for quantifying the exchange kinetics of plasma membrane and cytosolic populations of fluorescently labeled Lck, the key Src family kinase involved in early T cell signaling. Total internal reflection (TIR) fluorescence microscopy was employed for confining the analysis to membrane-proximal molecules. Upon photobleaching Lck-YFP in TIR configuration, fluorescence recovery proceeds first via the cytosol outside of the evanescent field, so that in the early phase fluorescence signal arises predominantly from membrane-proximal cytosolic Lck. The diffusion constant of each molecule allowed us to distinguish whether the molecule has already associated with the plasma membrane or was still freely diffusing in the cytosol. From the number of molecules that inserted during the recovery time we quantified the insertion kinetics: on average, membrane-proximal molecules within the evanescent field needed ?400 ms to be inserted. The average lifetime of Lck in the plasma membrane was estimated at 50 s; together with the mobility of 0.26 ?m2/s this provides sufficient time to explore the surface of the whole T cell before dissociation into the cytosol. Experiments on palmitoylation-deficient Lck mutants yielded similar on-rates, but substantially increased off-rates.

CERS2 activity has been reported to be specific toward very long fatty acid residues (C22–C24). In order to study the biological role of CERS2, we have inactivated its coding region in transgenic mice using gene-trapped embryonic stem cells that express lacZ reporter DNA under control of the cers2 promoter. The resulting mice lack ceramide synthase activity toward C24:1 in the brain as well as the liver and show only very low activity toward C18:0–C22:0 in liver and reduced activity toward C22:0 residues in the brain. In addition, these mice exhibit strongly reduced levels of ceramide species with very long fatty acid residues (≥C22) in the liver, kidney, and brain. From early adulthood on, myelin stainability is progressively lost, biochemically accompanied by about 50% loss of compacted myelin and 80% loss of myelin basic protein. Starting around 9 months, both the medullary tree and the internal granular layer of the cerebellum show significant signs of degeneration associated with the formation of microcysts. Predominantly in the peripheral nervous system, we observed vesiculation and multifocal detachment of the inner myelin lamellae in about 20% of the axons. Beyond 7 months, the CERS2-deficient mice developed hepatocarcinomas with local destruction of tissue architecture and discrete gaps in renal parenchyma. Our results indicate that CERS2 activity supports different biological functions: maintenance of myelin, stabilization of the cerebellar as well as renal histological architecture, and protection against hepatocarcinomas.","202272","Open Access","-0.1683","-0.0232","4","Hepatitis c virus, And signaling, Anti apoptotic","Hepatitis c virus, And signaling, Anti apoptotic",110,NA,NA,"",""

However, there is currently not much information on their size, shape, stability, surface density, composition, and heterogeneity. We present here a method that allows for the first time the direct imaging of nanoscopic long-lived platforms with raft-like properties diffusing in the live cell plasma membrane. Our method senses these platforms by their property to assemble a characteristic set of fluorescent marker proteins or lipids on a time scale of seconds. A special photobleaching protocol was used to reduce the surface density of labeled mobile platforms down to the level of well isolated diffraction-limited spots without altering the single spot brightness. The statistical distribution of probe molecules per platform was determined by single molecule brightness analysis. For demonstration, we used the consensus raft marker glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored monomeric GFP and the fluorescent lipid analog BODIPY-GM1, which preferentially partitions into liquid-ordered phases. For both markers, we found cholesterol-dependent homo-association in the plasma membrane of living CHO and Jurkat T cells in the resting state, thereby demonstrating the existence of small, mobile, long-lived platforms containing these probes. We further applied the technology to address structural changes in the plasma membrane during fever-type heat shock: at elevated temperatures, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored monomeric GFP homo-association disappeared, accompanied by an increase in the expression of the small heat shock protein Hsp27.","202272","Open Access","0.511","-0.2522","13","Plasma membrane, Membrane lipids, Lipid droplets","Plasma membrane, Membrane lipids, Lipid droplets",67,NA,NA,"",""

To identify components of the protein degradation machinery on LDs, we studied several candidates identified in previous LD proteome analyses. Here, we demonstrate that the highly conserved and broadly expressed ancient ubiquitous protein 1 (AUP1) localizes to LDs, where it integrates into the LD surface in a monotopic fashion with both termini facing the cytosol. AUP1 contains a C-terminal domain with strong homology to a domain known as G2BR, which binds E2 ubiquitin conjugases. We show that AUP1, by means of its G2BR domain, binds to Ube2g2. This binding is abolished by deletion or mutation of the G2BR domain, although the LD localization of AUP1 is not affected. The presence of the AUP1-Ube2g2 complex at LDs provides a direct molecular link between LDs and the cellular ubiquitination machinery.","202272","Open Access","0.5144","-0.0538","13","Plasma membrane, Membrane lipids, Lipid droplets","Plasma membrane, Membrane lipids, Lipid droplets",41,NA,NA,"",""

Our results present high resolution data on the acylglycerol and cholesterol ester species that were affected by the compounds. Moreover, triacsin C, which blocks both triglyceride and cholesterol ester synthesis, cleared most of the lipid droplets in cells. By contrast, YIC-C8-434, which only abrogates production of cholesterol esters, induced an increase in size of droplets. Although both compounds slightly reduced viral RNA synthesis, they significantly impaired assembly of infectious virions in infected cells. In the case of triacsin C, reduced stability of the viral core protein, which forms the virion nucleocapsid and is targeted to the surface of lipid droplets, correlated with lower virion assembly. In addition, the virus particles that were released from cells had reduced specific infectivity. YIC-C8-434 did not alter the association of core with lipid droplets but appeared to decrease production of infectious virus particles, suggesting a block in virion assembly. Thus, the compounds have antiviral properties, indicating that targeting synthesis of lipids stored in lipid droplets might be an option for therapeutic intervention in treating chronic hepatitis C virus infection.","202272","Open Access","0.5527","0.0027","4","Hepatitis c virus, And signaling, Anti apoptotic","Hepatitis c virus, And signaling, Anti apoptotic",19,NA,NA,"",""

The Influence of the Searched Protein Database on the Long-Term Storage of Proteomics Data","Griss, Johannes","2011-01-01","AMER SOC BIOCHEMISTRY MOLECULAR BIOLOGY INC","publication","","MOLECULAR & CELLULAR PROTEOMICS","","In proteomics, protein identifications are reported and stored using an unstable reference system: protein identifiers. These proprietary identifiers are created individually by every protein database and can change or may even be deleted over time. To estimate the effect of the searched protein sequence database on the long-term storage of proteomics data we analyzed the changes of reported protein identifiers from all public experiments in the Proteomics Identifications (PRIDE) database by November 2010. To map the submitted protein identifier to a currently active entry, two distinct approaches were used. The first approach used the Protein Identifier Cross Referencing (PICR) service at the EBI, which maps protein identifiers based on 100% sequence identity. The second one (called logical mapping algorithm) accessed the source databases and retrieved the current status of the reported identifier. Our analysis showed the differences between the main protein databases (International Protein Index (IPI), UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB), National Center for Biotechnological Information nr database (NCBI nr), and Ensembl) in respect to identifier stability. For example, whereas 20% of submitted IPI entries were deleted after two years, virtually all UniProtKB entries remained either active or replaced. Furthermore, the two mapping algorithms produced markedly different results. For example, the PICR service reported 10% more IPI entries deleted compared with the logical mapping algorithm. We found several cases where experiments contained more than 10% deleted identifiers already at the time of publication. We also assessed the proportion of peptide identifications in these data sets that still fitted the originally identified protein sequences. Finally, we performed the same overall analysis on all records from IPI, Ensembl, and UniProtKB: two releases per year were used, from 2005. This analysis showed for the first time the true effect of changing protein identifiers on proteomics data. Based on these findings, UniProtKB seems the best database for applications that rely on the long-term storage of proteomics data.","085949","Open Access","-0.5466","-0.2731","6","Osbp related protein, Caveolae field, Cavin proteins","Osbp related protein, Caveolae field, Cavin proteins",13,"51","1","",""

This prompted us to design and implement a whole new suite of tools that would build on the successes of the original PRIDE Converter and allow users to generate submission-ready, well-annotated PRIDE XML files. The PRIDE Converter 2 tool suite allows users to convert search result files into PRIDE XML (the format needed for performing submissions to the PRIDE database), generate mzTab skeleton files that can be used as a basis to submit quantitative and gel-based MS data, and post-process PRIDE XML files by filtering out contaminants and empty spectra, or by merging several PRIDE XML files together. All the tools have both a graphical user interface that provides a dialog-based, user-friendly way to convert and prepare files for submission, as well as a command-line interface that can be used to integrate the tools into existing or novel pipelines, for batch processing and power users.

The format has the capability to reference other standards such as mzML and mzIdentML, and thus the evidence trail for the MS workflow as a whole can now be described.

Many downstream analysis use cases are only concerned with the final results of an experiment and require an easily accessible format, compatible with tools such as Microsoft Excel or R.

These range from a simple summary of the final results to a representation of the results including the experimental design.

However, the molecular basis of this G2 block is not known. Here, we show that the G2-specific Golgi fragmentation stage is concomitant with centrosome recruitment and activation of the mitotic kinase Aurora-A, an essential regulator for entry into mitosis. We show that a block of Golgi partitioning impairs centrosome recruitment and activation of Aurora-A, which results in the G2 block of cell cycle progression. Overexpression of Aurora-A overrides this cell cycle block, indicating that Aurora-A is a major effector of the Golgi checkpoint.

It is still a challenging task to explain how the regulatory networks achieve the diversity of different cell types. Here, we report on our studies of the design principles of the tissue regulatory system by constructing the regulatory networks of eight human tissues, which subsume the regulatory interactions between transcription factors (TFs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and non-TF target genes. The results show that there are in-/out-hubs of high in-/out-degrees in tissue networks. Some hubs (strong hubs) maintain the hub status in all the tissues where they are expressed, whereas others (weak hubs), in spite of their ubiquitous expression, are hubs only in some tissues. The network motifs are mostly feed-forward loops. Some of them having no miRNAs are the common motifs shared by all tissues, whereas the others containing miRNAs are the tissue-specific ones owned by one or several tissues, indicating that the transcriptional regulation is more conserved across tissues than the post-transcriptional regulation. In particular, a common bow-tie framework was found that underlies the motif instances and shows diverse patterns in different tissues. Such bow-tie framework reflects the utilization efficiency of the regulatory system as well as its high variability in different tissues, and could serve as the model to further understand the structural adaptation of the regulatory system to the specific requirements of different cell functions.

It plays critical roles in the regulation of diverse processes, and mutations that directly or indirectly affect these phosphorylation events have been associated with many cancers and other pathologies. Here, we describe the development of a new BioMart tool that gathers data from three different biological resources to provide the user with an integrated view of phosphorylation events associated with a human protein of interest, the complexes of which the protein (modified or not) is a part, the reactions in which the protein and its complexes participate and the somatic mutations that might be expected to perturb those functions. The three resources used are the Reactome, PRIDE and COSMIC databases. The Reactome knowledgebase contains annotations of phosphorylated human proteins linked to the reactions in which they are phosphorylated and dephosphorylated, to the complexes of which they are parts and to the reactions in which the phosphorylated proteins participate as substrates, catalysts and regulators. The PRIDE database holds extensive mass spectrometry data from which protein phosphorylation patterns can be inferred, and the COSMIC database holds records of somatic mutations found in human cancer cells. This tool supports both flexible, user-specified queries and standard (?canned?) queries to retrieve frequently used combinations of data for user-specified proteins and reactions. We demonstrate using the Wnt signaling pathway and the human c-SRC protein how the tool can be used to place somatic mutation data into a functional perspective by changing critical residues involved in pathway modulation, and where available, check for mass spectrometry evidence in PRIDE supporting identification of the critical residue.

Transcription factors constitute a large functional family of proteins directly regulating the activity of genes. Most of them are sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, thus reading out the information encoded in cis-regulatory DNA elements of promoters, enhancers and other regulatory regions of a genome. TFClass is a database that classifies human transcription factors by a six-level classification schema, four of which are abstractions according to different criteria, while the fifth level represents TF genes and the sixth individual gene products. Altogether, nine superclasses have been identified, comprising 40 classes and 111 families. Counted by genes, 1558 human TFs have been classified so far or >2900 different TFs when including their isoforms generated by alternative splicing or protein processing events. With this classification, we hope to provide a basis for deciphering protein-DNA recognition codes; moreover, it can be used for constructing expanded transcriptional networks by inferring additional TF-target gene relations.

Complex lipids, such as glycosphingolipids, are constitutively degraded within the endolysosomal system by soluble hydrolytic enzymes with the help of lipid binding proteins in a sequential manner. Because of a functionally impaired hydrolase or auxiliary protein, their lipid substrates cannot be degraded, accumulate in the lysosome, and slowly spread to other intracellular membranes. In Niemann-Pick type C disease, cholesterol transport is impaired and unesterified cholesterol accumulates in the late endosome. In most lysosomal lipid storage diseases, the accumulation of one or few lipids leads to the coprecipitation of other hydrophobic substances in the endolysosomal system, such as lipids and proteins, causing a “traffic jam.” This can impair lysosomal function, such as delivery of nutrients through the endolysosomal system, leading to a state of cellular starvation. Therapeutic approaches are currently restricted to mild forms of diseases with significant residual catabolic activities and without brain involvement.","202272","Open Access","0.4605","0.0311","7","Lipid droplets, Caveolin deficient, Affects lxr","Lipid droplets, Caveolin deficient, Affects lxr",57,"78",NA,"",""

Here we report that in mice Hif1a activation in visceral white adipocytes is critical to maintain dietary obesity and associated pathologies including glucose intolerance insulin resistance and cardiomyopathy. This function of Hif1a is linked to its capacity to suppress ß oxidation in part through transcriptional repression of sirtuin 2 (Sirt2) NAD(+) dependent deacetylase. Reduced Sirt2 function directly translates into diminished deacetylation of PPAR? coactivator 1a (Pgc1a) and expression of ß oxidation and mitochondrial genes.

To understand these differences, we investigated host gene transcription in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by microarray and quantitative PCR in patients with genotype 1 (n?=?22) or genotype 3 infection (n?=?22) and matched healthy controls (n?=?15). Enrichment of genes involved in immune response and inflammatory pathways were present in patients infected with HCV genotype 1; however, no differences in genes involved in lipid or cholesterol metabolism were detected. This genotype-specific induction of genes is unrelated to IL28B genotype or previous treatment failure.

Aspirin treatment lowers inflammation via inhibition of NF-κB activity but also reduces hypertriglyceridemia in humans. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism by which aspirin improves hypertriglyceridemia. Human apolipoprotein CI (apoCI)-expressing mice (APOC1 mice), an animal model with elevated plasma triglyceride (TG) levels, as well as normolipidemic wild-type (WT) mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and treated with aspirin. Aspirin treatment reduced hepatic NF-κB activity in HFD-fed APOC1 and WT mice, and in addition, aspirin decreased plasma TG levels (−32%, P < 0.05) in hypertriglyceridemic APOC1 mice. This TG-lowering effect could not be explained by enhanced VLDL-TG clearance, but aspirin selectively reduced hepatic production of VLDL-TG in both APOC1 (−28%, P < 0.05) and WT mice (−33%, P < 0.05) without affecting VLDL-apoB production. Aspirin did not alter hepatic expression of genes involved in FA oxidation, lipogenesis, and VLDL production but decreased the incorporation of plasma-derived FA by the liver into VLDL-TG (−24%, P < 0.05), which was independent of hepatic expression of genes involved in FA uptake and transport. We conclude that aspirin improves hypertriglyceridemia by decreasing VLDL-TG production without affecting VLDL particle production. Therefore, the inhibition of inflammatory pathways by aspirin could be an interesting target for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia.","202272","Open Access","0.0459","-0.3561","12","High fat diet, Diet induced obesity, Obesity and insulin","High fat diet, Diet induced obesity, Obesity and insulin",13,NA,NA,"",""

Our existing understanding of the structure, protein organization, and biogenesis of the lipid droplet has relied heavily on microscopical techniques that lack resolution and the ability to preserve native cellular and protein composition. Freeze-fracture replica immunogold labeling overcomes these disadvantages and can be used to define at high resolution the precise location of lipid droplet-associated proteins. In this paper illustrative examples of how freeze-fracture immunocytochemistry has contributed to our understanding of the spatial organization in the membrane plane and function of PAT family proteins and caveolin-1 are presented.

Here we show that hypoxia/ischemia-induced accumulation of lipids in HL-1 cardiomyocytes and mouse hearts is dependent on expression of the VLDL receptor (VLDLR). Hypoxia-induced VLDLR expression in HL-1 cells was dependent on HIF-1α through its interaction with a hypoxia-responsive element in the Vldlr promoter, and VLDLR promoted the endocytosis of lipoproteins. Furthermore, VLDLR expression was higher in ischemic compared with nonischemic left ventricles from human hearts and was correlated with the total lipid droplet area in the cardiomyocytes. Importantly, Vldlr–/– mice showed improved survival and decreased infarct area following an induced myocardial infarction. ER stress, which leads to apoptosis, is known to be involved in ischemic heart disease. We found that ischemia-induced ER stress and apoptosis in mouse hearts were reduced in Vldlr–/– mice and in mice treated with antibodies specific for VLDLR. These findings suggest that VLDLR-induced lipid accumulation in the ischemic heart worsens survival by increasing ER stress and apoptosis.

While the theoretical approaches emphasize the global characterization of regulatory systems, the practical approaches focus on the role of distinct molecules and genes in regulation. To bridge the gap between these opposite approaches, one needs to combine 'general' with 'particular' properties and translate abstract topological features of large systems into testable functional characteristics of individual components. Here, we propose a new topological parameter – the pairwise disconnectivity index of a network's element – that is capable of such bridging.</p> <p>Results</p> <p>The pairwise disconnectivity index quantifies how crucial an individual element is for sustaining the communication ability between connected pairs of vertices in a network that is displayed as a directed graph. Such an element might be a vertex (i.e., molecules, genes), an edge (i.e., reactions, interactions), as well as a group of vertices and/or edges. The index can be viewed as a measure of topological redundancy of regulatory paths which connect different parts of a given network and as a measure of sensitivity (robustness) of this network to the presence (absence) of each individual element. Accordingly, we introduce the notion of a path-degree of a vertex in terms of its corresponding incoming, outgoing and mediated paths, respectively.

Intercellular signaling (mostly mediated by hormones) can affect the metabolic state and the gene expression program of target cells, thereby coordinating development, homeostasis of the organism and its reactions to external stimuli. Knowledge of the components of the intercellular signaling (specifically: the endocrine) network and their relations is an important, though so far a largely neglected part of systems biology. Description EndoNet is an information resource about the endocrine system in human. The content of this database comprises information about the biological components of the endocrine system, like hormones, receptors and cells, as well as their relations like the secretion or the binding of a hormone to its receptor. All data within EndoNet have been manually annotated from the scientific literature. The web interface of EndoNet provides the content by a detailed page for each component. These pages list information about the component, links to external resources including literature as well as to related entities of EndoNet. The anatomical ontology Cytomer is used, in conjunction with the Ontology Based Answers service (OBA), to query and list related anatomical structures ranging from the level of individual cells to complete organs. While querying the web interface the user can add components to an individual network. This network, or the complete network stored in the database, can be further analyzed in a configurable pipeline or can be exported in various formats. Conclusion EndoNet is an important and unique information resource about the intercellular signaling network. Since the intercellular network is an integral part of systems biology, EndoNet provides essential information for analyzing interaction between different cellular networks.

To understand the differential role of sphingolipids in a regulatory network, it is important to use specific and quantitative methods. We developed a novel LC-MS/MS method for the rapid, simultaneous quantification of sphingolipid metabolites, including sphingosine, sphinganine, phyto-sphingosine, di- and trimethyl-sphingosine, sphingosylphosphorylcholine, hexosylceramide, lactosylceramide, ceramide-1-phosphate, and dihydroceramide-1-phosphate. Appropriate internal standards (ISs) were added prior to lipid extraction. In contrast to most published methods based on reversed phase chromatography, we used hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography and achieved good peak shapes, a short analysis time of 4.5 min, and, most importantly, coelution of analytes and their respective ISs. To avoid an overestimation of species concentrations, peak areas were corrected regarding isotopic overlap where necessary. Quantification was achieved by standard addition of naturally occurring sphingolipid species to the sample matrix. The method showed excellent precision, accuracy, detection limits, and robustness. As an example, sphingolipid species were quantified in fibroblasts treated with myriocin or sphingosine-kinase inhibitor.

They also locate around intracellular lipid droplets but their role in this location remains unclear. By studying primary adipocytes that highly express caveolin-1, we characterized the impact of caveolin-1 deficiency on lipid droplet proteome and lipidome. We identified several missing proteins on the lipid droplet surface of caveolin-deficient adipocytes and showed that the caveolin-1 lipid droplet pool is organized as multi-protein complexes containing cavin-1, with similar dynamics as those found in caveolae. On the lipid side, caveolin deficiency did not qualitatively alter neutral lipids in lipid droplet, but significantly reduced the relative abundance of surface phospholipid species: phosphatidylserine and lysophospholipids. Caveolin-deficient adipocytes can form only small lipid droplets, suggesting that the caveolin-lipid droplet pool might be involved in lipid droplet size regulation. Accordingly, we show that caveolin-1 concentration on adipocyte lipid droplets positively correlated with lipid droplet size in obese rodent models and human adipocytes. Moreover, rescue experiments by caveolin- green fluorescent protein in caveolin-deficient cells exposed to fatty acid overload demonstrated that caveolin-coated lipid droplets were able to grow larger than caveolin-devoid lipid droplets. Altogether, these data demonstrate that the lipid droplet-caveolin pool impacts on phospholipid and protein surface composition of lipid droplets and suggest a functional role on lipid droplet expandability.","202272","Open Access","0.517","0.1482","7","Lipid droplets, Caveolin deficient, Affects lxr","Lipid droplets, Caveolin deficient, Affects lxr",54,NA,NA,"",""

Cholesterol transfer was greatly stimulated by BMP, little by ceramide, and strongly inhibited by sphingomyelin. Cholesterol and ceramide were also significantly transferred in the absence of protein. This spontaneous transfer of cholesterol was greatly enhanced by ceramide, slightly by BMP, and strongly inhibited by sphingomyelin. In our transfer assay, biotinylated donor liposomes were separated from fluorescent acceptor liposomes by streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. Thus, the loss of fluorescence indicated membrane fusion. Ceramide induced spontaneous fusion of lipid vesicles even at very low concentrations, while BMP and sphingomyelin did so at about 20 mol% and 10 mol% concentrations, respectively. In addition to transfer of cholesterol, NPC2 induced membrane fusion, although less than saposin-C.

Additionally, it can cleave other substrates, including proteins involved in metabolism. Recently, we showed that caspase-1 deficiency in mice strongly reduces high-fat diet-induced weight gain, at least partly caused by an increased energy production. Increased feces secretion by caspase-1-deficient mice suggests that lipid malabsorption possibly further reduces adipose tissue mass. In this study we investigated whether caspase-1 plays a role in triglyceride-(TG)-rich lipoprotein metabolism using caspase-1-deficient and wild-type mice. Caspase-1 deficiency reduced the postprandial TG response to an oral lipid load, whereas TG-derived fatty acid (FA) uptake by peripheral tissues was not affected, demonstrated by unaltered kinetics of [3H]TG- labeled very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-like emulsion particles. An oral gavage of [3H]TG-containing olive oil revealed that caspase-1 deficiency reduced TG absorption and subsequent uptake of TG-derived FA in liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. Similarly, despite an elevated hepatic TG content, caspase-1 deficiency reduced hepatic VLDL-TG production. Intestinal and hepatic gene expression analysis revealed that caspase-1 deficiency did not affect FA oxidation or FA uptake but rather reduced intracellular FA transport, thereby limiting lipid availability for the assembly and secretion of TG-rich lipoproteins. The current study reveals a novel function for caspase-1, or caspase-1-cleaved substrates, in controlling intestinal TG absorption and hepatic TG secretion.

It aims to add defined levels of information below the LIPID MAPS nomenclature, as detailed chemical structures, including stereochemistry, are usually not automatically provided by mass spectrometric analysis. To this end, rules for lipid species annotation were developed that reflect the structural information derived from the analysis. For example, commonly used head group-specific analysis of glycerophospholipids (GP) by low-resolution instruments is neither capable of differentiating the fatty acids linked to the glycerol backbone nor able to define their bond type (ester, alkyl-, or alk-1-enyl-ether). This and other missing structural information is covered by the proposed shorthand notation presented here. Beyond GPs, we provide shorthand notation for fatty acids/acyls (FA), glycerolipids (GL), sphingolipids (SP), and sterols (ST).

L.","2013-01-01","AMER SOC BIOCHEMISTRY MOLECULAR BIOLOGY INC","publication","","The Journal of Lipid Research","","The mechanism of action of 2-hydroxyoleic acid (2OHOA), a potent antitumor drug, involves the rapid and specific activation of sphingomyelin synthase (SMS), leading to a 4-fold increase in SM mass in tumor cells. In the present study, we investigated the source of the ceramides required to sustain this dramatic increase in SM. Through radioactive and fluorescent labeling, we demonstrated that sphingolipid metabolism was altered by a 24 h exposure to 2OHOA, and we observed a consistent increase in the number of lysosomes and the presence of unidentified storage materials in treated cells. Mass spectroscopy revealed that different sphingolipid classes accumulated in human glioma U118 cells after exposure to 2OHOA, demonstrating a specific effect on C16-, C20-, and C22-containing sphingolipids. Based on these findings, we propose that the demand for ceramides required to sustain the SMS activation (ca. 200-fold higher than the basal level) profoundly modifies both sphingolipid and phospholipid metabolism. As the treatment is prolonged, tumor cells fail to adequately metabolize sphingolipids, leading to a situation resembling sphingolipidosis, whereby cell viability is compromised.","202272","Open Access","0.0268","-0.0114","11","Sphingolipid species, Chemistry, Human synovial fluid","Sphingolipid species, Chemistry, Human synovial fluid",7,NA,NA,"",""

Targeted deletion of the Atgl gene in mice HSCs had little effect on the decrease of the overall TAG, CE and RE levels during activation. However, ATGL-deficient HSCs specifically accumulated TAG species enriched in PUFAs and degraded new TAG species more slowly. TAG synthesis and levels of PUFA-TAGs were lowered by the DGAT1 inhibitor T863. The lipase inhibitor Atglistatin increased the levels of TAG in both wt and ATGL-deficient mouse HSCs. Both Atglistatin and T863 inhibited the induction of activation marker α-SMA in rat HSCs, but not in mouse HSCs. Compared to mouse, rat HSCs have a higher turnover of new TAGs and Atglistatin and the DGAT1 inhibitor T863 were more effective. Our data suggest that ATGL preferentially degrades newly synthesized TAGs, synthesized by DGAT1, and is less involved in the breakdown of pre-existing TAGs and retinyl esters in HSCs.

Silencing of ORP2 using RNA interference slows down cellular triglyceride hydrolysis. Furthermore, ORP2 silencing increases the amount of [14C]cholesteryl esters but only under conditions in which lipogenesis and LD formation are enhanced by treatment with oleic acid.

Chronic low grade inflammation is a pathogenic component of IR and adipose tissue dysfunction in obesity induced type 2 diabetes. Because feline diabetes closely resembles human type 2 diabetes we studied whether lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced subacute inflammation in the absence of obesity is the potential primary cause of IR and metabolic disorders. Cats received increasing iv doses (10–1000 ng/kg-1 · h-1) of LPS (n = 5) or saline (n = 5) for 10 d. Body temperature proinflammatory and metabolic markers and insulin sensitivity were measured daily. Tissue mRNA and protein expression were quantified on d 10. LPS infusion increased circulating and tissue markers of inflammation. Based on the homeostasis model assessment endotoxemia induced transient IR and ß cell dysfunction. At the whole body level IR reverted after the 10 d treatment; however tissue specific indications of IR were observed such as down regulation of adipose glucose transporter 4 hepatic peroxisome proliferative activated receptor ?1 and  2 and muscle insulin receptor substrate 1. In adipose tissue increased hormone sensitive lipase activity led to reduced adipocyte size concomitant with increased plasma and hepatic triglyceride content and decreased total and high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Prolonged LPS induced inflammation caused acute IR followed by long lasting tissue specific dysfunctions of lipid  glucose  and insulin metabolism related targets; this ultimately resulted in dyslipidemia but not whole body IR. Endotoxemia in cats may provide a promising model to study the cross talk between metabolic and inflammatory responses in the development of adipose tissue dysfunction and IR.","202272","Open Access","-0.0757","0.0367","5","Lipid metabolism, Metabolic syndrome, Atherogenic disease","Lipid metabolism, Metabolic syndrome, Atherogenic disease",20,NA,NA,"",""

Neutrophils, important cells of the innate immune system, maintain the body's defence against infection. Previous studies have implicated PLD-generated PA in neutrophil function; these have relied heavily on the use of primary alcohols to act as inhibitors of PA production. The recent development of isoform-selective small molecule inhibitors and the generation of a knockout mouse model provide us with accurate tools to study the role of PLDs in neutrophil responses. We show that PLD1 is a regulator of phorbol-ester-, chemoattractant, adhesion-dependent and Fcγ-receptor-stimulated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neutrophils. Significantly we found that this role of PLD is isoform specific: the absence of PLD2 does not negatively affect these processes. Contrary to expectation, other functions required for an efficient immune response operate effectively in Pld2-deficient neutrophils or when both isoforms are inhibited pharmacologically. We conclude that although PLD1 does have important regulatory roles in neutrophils, the field has been confused by the use of primary alcohols; now that gold standard Pld-knockout mouse models are available, previous work might need to be reassessed.","202272","Open Access","0.1938","-0.4406","4","Hepatitis c virus, And signaling, Anti apoptotic","Hepatitis c virus, And signaling, Anti apoptotic",18,NA,NA,"",""

On the basis of these genetic loss- and gain-of-function experiments, we concluded that REV-ERBalpha participates in the circadian modulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) activity, and thereby in the daily expression of SREBP target genes involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism. This control is exerted via the cyclic transcription of Insig2, encoding a trans-membrane protein that sequesters SREBP proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum membranes and thereby interferes with the proteolytic activation of SREBPs in Golgi membranes. REV-ERBalpha also participates in the cyclic expression of cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme in converting cholesterol to bile acids. Our findings suggest that this control acts via the stimulation of LXR nuclear receptors by cyclically produced oxysterols. In conclusion, our study suggests that rhythmic cholesterol and bile acid metabolism is not just driven by alternating feeding-fasting cycles, but also by REV-ERBalpha, a component of the circadian clockwork circuitry.","202272","Open Access","-0.0098","-0.2749","13","Plasma membrane, Membrane lipids, Lipid droplets","Plasma membrane, Membrane lipids, Lipid droplets",176,"159",NA,"",""

Increasingly, variants within a few of the genes that encode enzymes involved in sphingolipid metabolism are being associated with complex disease phenotypes. Direct experimental evidence supports a role of specific sphingolipid species in several common complex chronic disease processes including atherosclerotic plaque formation, myocardial infarction (MI), cardiomyopathy, pancreatic beta-cell failure, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, sphingolipids represent novel and important intermediate phenotypes for genetic analysis, yet little is known about the major genetic variants that influence their circulating levels in the general population. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) between 318,237 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and levels of circulating sphingomyelin (SM), dihydrosphingomyelin (Dih-SM), ceramide (Cer), and glucosylceramide (GluCer) single lipid species (33 traits); and 43 matched metabolite ratios measured in 4,400 subjects from five diverse European populations. Associated variants (32) in five genomic regions were identified with genome-wide significant corrected p-values ranging down to 9.08 x 10(-66). The strongest associations were observed in or near 7 genes functionally involved in ceramide biosynthesis and trafficking: SPTLC3, LASS4, SGPP1, ATP10D, and FADS1-3. Variants in 3 loci (ATP10D, FADS3, and SPTLC3) associate with MI in a series of three German MI studies. An additional 70 variants across 23 candidate genes involved in sphingolipid-metabolizing pathways also demonstrate association (p = 10(-4) or less). Circulating concentrations of several key components in sphingolipid metabolism are thus under strong genetic control, and variants in these loci can be tested for a role in the development of common cardiovascular, metabolic, neurological, and psychiatric diseases.","202272","Open Access","-0.0183","0.2128","11","Sphingolipid species, Chemistry, Human synovial fluid","Sphingolipid species, Chemistry, Human synovial fluid",89,"105",NA,"",""

Adenoviral overexpression of ORP8 in mouse liver induced a decrease of cholesterol, phospholipids, and triglycerides in serum (-34%, -26%, -37%, respectively) and liver tissue (-40%, -12%, -24%), coinciding with reduction of nuclear (n)SREBP-1 and -2 and mRNA levels of their target genes. Consistently, excess ORP8 reduced nSREBPs in HuH7 cells, and ORP8 overexpression or silencing by RNA interference moderately suppressed or induced the expression of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 target genes, respectively. In accordance, cholesterol biosynthesis was reduced by ORP8 overexpression and enhanced by ORP8 silencing in [(3)H]acetate pulse-labeling experiments. ORP8, previously shown to bind 25-hydroxycholesterol, was now shown to bind also cholesterol in vitro. Yeast two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), and co-immunoprecipitation analyses revealed the nuclear pore component Nup62 as an interaction partner of ORP8. Co-localization of ORP8 and Nup62 at the nuclear envelope was demonstrated by BiFC and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, the impact of overexpressed ORP8 on nSREBPs and their target mRNAs was inhibited in cells depleted of Nup62.

HSP co-inducer hydroxylamines such as BGP-15 provide advanced therapeutic candidates for many diseases since they preferentially affect stressed cells and are unlikely have major side effects. In the present study in vitro molecular dynamic simulation, experiments with lipid monolayers and in vivo ultrasensitive fluorescence microscopy showed that BGP-15 alters the organization of cholesterol-rich membrane domains. Imaging of nanoscopic long-lived platforms using the raft marker glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored monomeric green fluorescent protein diffusing in the live Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell plasma membrane demonstrated that BGP-15 prevents the transient structural disintegration of rafts induced by fever-type heat stress. Moreover, BGP-15 was able to remodel cholesterol-enriched lipid platforms reminiscent of those observed earlier following non-lethal heat priming or membrane stress, and were shown to be obligate for the generation and transmission of stress signals. BGP-15 activation of HSP expression in B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells involves the Rac1 signaling cascade in accordance with the previous observation that cholesterol affects the targeting of Rac1 to membranes. Finally, in a human embryonic kidney cell line we demonstrate that BGP-15 is able to inhibit the rapid heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) acetylation monitored during the early phase of heat stress, thereby promoting a prolonged duration of HSF1 binding to heat shock elements. Taken together, our results indicate that BGP-15 has the potential to become a new class of pharmaceuticals for use in 'membrane-lipid therapy' to combat many various protein-misfolding diseases associated with aging.","I 301","Open Access","0.4284","-0.3381","13","Plasma membrane, Membrane lipids, Lipid droplets","Plasma membrane, Membrane lipids, Lipid droplets",42,NA,NA,"",""

Although the adipose tissue constitutes a major intern reservoir of PCBs and recent epidemiological studies associate PCBs to the development of obesity and its related disorders, little is known about the mechanisms involved in their uptake by the adipose tissue and their intracellular localization in fat cells. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have examined the intracellular distribution of PCBs in mouse cultured adipocytes and tested the potential involvement of caveolin-1, an abundant adipocyte membrane protein, in the uptake of these compounds by fat cells. We show that 2,4,4'-trichlorobiphenyl (PCB-28), 2,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB-118) and 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-153) congeners rapidly and extensively accumulate in 3T3-L1 or mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) derived cultured adipocytes. The dynamics of accumulation differed between the 3 congeners tested. By subcellular fractionation of primary adipocytes, we demonstrate that these pollutants were almost exclusively recovered within the lipid droplet fraction and practically not associated to cell membranes. The absence of caveolin-1 expression in primary adipocytes from cav-1 deficient mice did not modify lipid droplet selective targeting of PCBs. In cav-1 KO MEF differentiated adipocytes, PCB accumulation was decreased, which correlated with reduced cell triglyceride content. Conversely, adenoviral mediated cav-1 overexpressing in 3T3-L1 cells, which had no impact on total cell lipid content, did not change PCB accumulation. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data indicate that caveolin-1 per se is not required for selective PCB accumulation, but rather point out a primary dependence on adipocyte triglyceride content. If the crucial role of lipid droplets in energy homeostasis is considered, the almost exclusive accumulation of PCBs in these organelles warrants future attention as the impairment of their function could be linked to the worldwide obesity epidemic.","202272","Open Access","0.3951","-0.1364","8","Human adipose tissue, Metabolism, Article","Human adipose tissue, Metabolism, Article",19,"23","2","",""

During activation, hepatic stellate cells transform into myofibroblasts with concomitant loss of their lipid droplets (LDs) and production of excessive extracellular matrix. Here we aimed to obtain more insight in the dynamics and mechanism of LD loss. We have investigated the LD degradation processes in rat hepatic stellate cells in vitro with a combined approach of confocal Raman microspectroscopy and mass spectrometric analysis of lipids (lipidomics). Upon activation of the hepatic stellate cells, LDs reduce in size, but increase in number during the first 7 days, but the total volume of neutral lipids did not decrease. The LDs also migrate to cellular extensions in the first 7 days, before they disappear. In individual hepatic stellate cells. all LDs have a similar Raman spectrum, suggesting a similar lipid profile. However, Raman studies also showed that the retinyl esters are degraded more rapidly than the triacylglycerols upon activation. Lipidomic analyses confirmed that after 7 days in culture hepatic stellate cells have lost most of their retinyl esters, but not their triacylglycerols and cholesterol esters. Furthermore, we specifically observed a large increase in triacylglycerol-species containing polyunsaturated fatty acids, partly caused by an enhanced incorporation of exogenous arachidonic acid. These results reveal that lipid droplet degradation in activated hepatic stellate cells is a highly dynamic and regulated process. The rapid replacement of retinyl esters by polyunsaturated fatty acids in LDs suggests a role for both lipids or their derivatives like eicosanoids during hepatic stellate cell activation.","202272","Open Access","0.3192","0.0161","4","Hepatitis c virus, And signaling, Anti apoptotic","Hepatitis c virus, And signaling, Anti apoptotic",30,NA,NA,"",""

Clear-cell RCC cells are characterized histologically by accumulation of cholesterol, mainly in its ester form. The origin of the increased cholesterol remains unclear, but it is likely explained by an HIF-1 alpha-driven imbalance between cholesterol uptake and excretion. Here, we showed that expression of the very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDL-R) was significantly increased in clear-cell RCC human biopsies compared with normal kidney tissue. Partial knockdown of HIF-1 alpha in clear-cell RCC cells significantly reduced the VLDL-R expression, and knockdown of either HIF-1 alpha or VLDL-R reduced the increased lipid accumulation observed in these cells. We also showed increased uptake of fluorescently labeled lipoproteins in clear-cell RCC cells, which was significantly reduced by knockdown of HIF-1 alpha or VLDL-R. Taken together, our results support the concept that the pathological increase of HIF-1 alpha in clear-cell RCC cells upregulates VLDL-R, which mediates increased uptake and accumulation of lipids. These results explain the morphological characteristics of clear-cell RCC, and open up novel possibilities for detection and treatment of clear-cell RCC.","202272","Open Access","0.3383","-0.3283","4","Hepatitis c virus, And signaling, Anti apoptotic","Hepatitis c virus, And signaling, Anti apoptotic",10,NA,NA,"",""

Wild-type and Osbpl8KO animals at the age of 13-weeks were fed for 5 weeks either chow or high-fat diet, and their plasma lipids/lipoproteins and hepatic lipids were analyzed. The chow-fed Osbpl8KO male mice showed a marked elevation of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (+79%) and phospholipids (+35%), while only minor increase of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) was detected. In chow-fed female KO mice a less prominent increase of HDL cholesterol (+27%) was observed, while on western diet the HDL increment was prominent in both genders. The HDL increase was accompanied by an elevated level of HDL-associated apolipoprotein E in male, but not female KO animals. No differences between genotypes were observed in lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) or hepatic lipase (HL) activity, or in the fractional catabolic rate of fluorescently labeled mouse HDL injected in chow-diet fed animals. The Osbpl8KO mice of both genders displayed reduced phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) activity, but only on chow diet. These findings are consistent with a model in which Osbpl8 deficiency results in altered biosynthesis of HDL. Consistent with this hypothesis, ORP8 depleted mouse hepatocytes secreted an increased amount of nascent HDL into the culture medium. In addition to the HDL phenotype, distinct gender-specific alterations in lipid metabolism were detected: Female KO animals on chow diet showed reduced lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity and increased plasma triglycerides, while the male KO mice displayed elevated plasma cholesterol biosynthetic markers cholestenol, desmosterol, and lathosterol. Moreover, modest gender-specific alterations in the hepatic expression of lipid homeostatic genes were observed.

Plasmalogens represent ether lipids that play a role in diabesity and previous data show diminished plasmalogen levels in obese subjects. We therefore analyzed transcriptomic and lipidomic changes during monocyte-macrophage differentiation in vitro using a bioinformatic approach. METHODS: Elutriated monocytes from 13 healthy donors were differentiated in vitro to macrophages using rhM-CSF under serum-free conditions. Samples were taken on days 0, 1, 4 and 5 and analyzed for their lipidomic and transcriptomic profiles. RESULTS: Gene expression analysis showed strong regulation of lipidome-related transcripts. Enzymes involved in fatty acid desaturation and elongation were increasingly expressed, peroxisomal and ER stress related genes were induced. Total plasmalogen levels remained unchanged, while the PE plasmalogen species pattern became more similar to circulating granulocytes, showing decreases in PUFA and increases in MUFA. A partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS/DA) revealed that PE plasmalogens discriminate the stage of monocyte-derived macrophage differentiation. Partial correlation analysis could predict novel potential key nodes including DOCK1, PDK4, GNPTAB and FAM126A that might be involved in regulating lipid and especially plasmalogen homeostasis during differentiation. An in silico transcription analysis of lipid related regulation revealed known motifs such as PPAR-gamma and KLF4 as well as novel candidates such as NFY, RNF96 and Zinc-finger proteins. CONCLUSION: Monocyte to macrophage differentiation goes along with profound changes in the lipid-related transcriptome. This leads to an induction of fatty-acid desaturation and elongation. In their PE-plasmalogen profile macrophages become more similar to granulocytes than monocytes, indicating terminal phagocytic differentiation. Therefore PE plasmalogens may represent potential biomarkers for cell activation. For the underlying transcriptional network we were able to predict a range of novel central key nodes and underlying transcription factors using a bioinformatic approach.","202272","Open Access","0.0376","-0.1107","8","Human adipose tissue, Metabolism, Article","Human adipose tissue, Metabolism, Article",13,"35","1","",""

The degradation of atherogenic lipoproteins subsequently leads to alterations in cellular lipid metabolism that influence inflammatory signaling. Especially sphingolipids and ceramides are known to be involved in these processes. We therefore analyzed monocyte derived macrophages during differentiation and after loading with enzymatically (eLDL) and oxidatively (oxLDL) modified low-density lipoproteins (LDL). Methods Primary human monocytes were isolated from healthy, normolipidemic blood donors using leukapheresis and counterflow elutriation. On the fourth day of MCSF-induced differentiation eLDL (40 ?g/ml) or oxLDL (80 ?g/ml) were added for 48h. Lipid species were analyzed by quantitative tandem mass spectrometry. Taqman qPCR was performed to investigate transcriptional changes in enzymes involved in sphingolipid metabolism. Furthermore, membrane lipids were studied using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Results MCSF dependent phagocytic differentiation of blood monocytes had only minor effects on the sphingolipid composition. Levels of total sphingomyelin and total ceramide remained unchanged, while lactosylceramides, cholesterylesters and free cholesterol decreased. At the species level most ceramide species showed a reduction upon phagocytic differentiation. Loading with eLDL preferentially increased cellular cholesterol while loading with oxLDL increased cellular ceramide content. Activation of the salvage pathway with a higher mRNA expression of acid and neutral sphingomyelinase, neutral sphingomyelinase activation associated factor and glucosylceramidase as well as increased surface expression of SMPD1 were identified as potentially underlying mechanisms. Moreover, flow-cytometric analysis revealed a higher cell-surface-expression of ceramide, lactosylceramide (CDw17), globotriaosylceramide (CD77), dodecasaccharide-ceramide (CD65s) and GM1 ganglioside upon oxLDL loading. ApoE in contrast to apoA-I preferentially bound to the ceramide enriched surfaces of oxLDL loaded cells. Confocal microscopy showed a co-localization of acid sphingomyelinase with ceramide rich membrane microdomains.

			Sequence variants near the human gene for P4-type ATPase, class V, type 10D (ATP10D) were shown to significantly associate with circulating hexosylceramide d18:1/16:0 and d18:1/24:1 levels, obesity, insulin resistance, plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL), coronary stenotic index and intracranial atherosclerotic index. In mice Atp10d is associated with HDL modulation and C57BL/6 mice expressing a truncated, non-functional form of ATP10D easily develop obesity and insulin resistance on high-fat diet.

			Results

			We analyzed metabolic differences of ATP10D deficient C57BL/6J wild type and ATP10D transgenic C57BL/6J BAC129 mice. ATP10D transgenic mice gain 25% less weight on high-fat diet concomitant with a reduced increase in fat cell mass but independent of adipocyte size change. ATP10D transgenic mice also had 26% lower triacylglycerol levels with approximately 76% bound to very low density lipoprotein while in ATP10D deficient wild type mice 57% are bound to low density lipoprotein. Furthermore increased oxygen consumption and CO2 production, 38% lower glucose and 69% lower insulin levels and better insulin sensitivity were observed in ATP10D transgenic mice. Besides decreased hexosylceramide species levels were detected. Part of these effects may be due to reduced hepatic stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) expression in ATP10D transgenic mice, which was reflected by altered fatty acid and lipid species patterns. There was a significant decrease in the hepatic 18:1 to 18:0 free fatty acid ratio in transgenic mice. The ratio of 16:1 to 16:0 was not significantly different. Interestingly both ratios were significantly reduced in plasma total fatty acids.

			Summary

			In summary we found that ATP10D reduces high-fat diet induced obesity and improves insulin sensitivity. ATP10D transgenic mice showed altered hepatic expression of lipid-metabolism associated genes, including Scd1, along with changes in hepatic and plasma lipid species and plasma lipoprotein pattern.

Target mRNAs and pathways were predicted for the miRNAs most significantly upregulated in NAFLD, their cell?type?specific expression was investigated by quantitative PCR (qPCR), and the transcriptome of immortalized human hepatocytes (IHH) transfected with the miRNA with the highest number of predicted targets, miR?576?5p, was studied. The screen revealed 42 miRNAs up? and two downregulated in the NAFLD as compared to non?NAFLD liver. The miRNAs differing most significantly between the groups, miR?103a?2*, miR?106b, miR?576?5p, miRPlus?I137*, miR?892a, miR?1282, miR?3663?5p, and miR?3924, were all upregulated in NAFLD liver. Target pathways predicted for these miRNAs included ones involved in cancer, metabolic regulation, insulin signaling, and inflammation. Consistent transcriptome changes were observed in IHH transfected with miR?576?5p, and western analysis revealed a marked reduction of the RAC1 protein belonging to several miR?576?5p target pathways. To conclude, we identified 44 miRNAs differentially expressed in NAFLD versus non?NAFLD liver, 42 of these being novel in the context of NAFLD. The study demonstrates that by applying a novel study set?up and a broad?coverage array platform one can reveal a wealth of previously undiscovered miRNA dysregulation in metabolic disease.","202272","Open Access","-0.1071","-0.524","8","Human adipose tissue, Metabolism, Article","Human adipose tissue, Metabolism, Article",6,"24","5","",""

These biomarkers can be used in clinical applications for diagnosis, stratification of patients for specific treatment, or therapy monitoring. New protein array formats and improved spectrometry technologies have brought these analyses to a level with potential for use in clinical diagnostics. The nature of the human body fluid proteome with its large dynamic range of protein concentrations presents problems with quantitation. The extreme complexity of the proteome in body fluids presents enormous challenges and requires the establishment of standard operating procedures for handling of specimens, increasing sensitivity for detection and bioinformatical tools for distribution of proteomic data into the public domain. From studies of in vitro diagnostics, especially in clinical chemistry, it is evident that most errors occur in the preanalytical phase and during implementation of the diagnostic strategy. This is also true for clinical proteomics, and especially for fluid proteomics because of the multiple pretreatment processes. These processes include depletion of high-abundance proteins from plasma or enrichment processes for urine where biological variation or differences in proteolytic activities in the sample along with preanalytical variables such as inter- and intra-assay variability will likely influence the results of proteomics studies. However, before proteomic analysis can be introduced at a broader level into the clinical setting, standardization of the preanalytical phase including patient preparation, sample collection, sample preparation, sample storage, measurement and data analysis needs to be improved. In this review, we discuss the recent technological advances and applications that fulfil the criteria for clinical proteomics, with the focus on fluid proteomics. These advances relate to preanalytical factors, analytical standardization and quality-control measures required for effective implementation into routine laboratory testing in order to generate clinically useful information. With new disease biomarker candidates, it will be crucial to design and perform clinical studies that can identify novel diagnostic strategies based on these techniques, and to validate their impact on clinical decision-making.

Strongly expressed in the liver and intestine, FXR has been shown to be the master transcriptional regulator of several entero-hepatic metabolic pathways with relevance to the pathophysiology of conditions such as cholestasis, fatty liver disease, cholesterol gallstone disease, intestinal inflammation and tumors. Furthermore, given the importance of FXR in the gut-liver axis feedbacks regulating lipid and glucose homeostasis, FXR modulation appears to have great input in diseases such as metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Exciting results from several cellular and animal models have provided the impetus to develop synthetic FXR ligands as novel pharmacological agents. Fourteen years from its discovery, FXR has gone from bench to bedside; a novel nuclear receptor ligand is going into clinical use.","202272","Open Access","-0.2828","-0.1536","3","Bile acid receptor, Acid receptor fxr, Nuclear bile acid","Bile acid receptor, Acid receptor fxr, Nuclear bile acid",12,"96","3","",""

We investigated potential proatherogenic properties of apoCIII-containing LDL from hypertriglyceridemic patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS LDL was isolated from control subjects, subjects with type 2 diabetes, and apoB transgenic mice. LDL-biglycan binding was analyzed with a solid-phase assay using immunoplates coated with biglycan. Lipid composition was analyzed with mass spectrometry. Hydrolysis of LDL by sphingomyelinase was analyzed after labeling plasma LDL with [3H]sphingomyelin. ApoCIII isoforms were quantified after isoelectric focusing. Human aortic endothelial cells were incubated with desialylated apoCIII or with LDL enriched with specific apoCIII isoforms. RESULTS We showed that enriching LDL with apoCIII only induced a small increase in LDL-proteoglycan binding, and this effect was dependent on a functional site A in apoB100. Our findings indicated that intrinsic characteristics of the diabetic LDL other than apoCIII are responsible for further increased proteoglycan binding of diabetic LDL with high-endogenous apoCIII, and we showed alterations in the lipid composition of diabetic LDL with high apoCIII. We also demonstrated that high apoCIII increased susceptibility of LDL to hydrolysis and aggregation by sphingomyelinases. In addition, we demonstrated that sialylation of apoCIII increased with increasing apoCIII content and that sialylation of apoCIII was essential for its proinflammatory properties.

In different cells, two distinct mechanisms have been proposed to mediate ceramide inhibition of PKB/Akt: one involving atypical protein kinase C zeta (PKCζ) and the other the protein phosphatase-2 (PP2A). We hypothesized that ceramide action through PKCζ or PP2A might depend on plasma membrane (PM) structural organization and especially on caveolin-enriched domain (CEM) abundance. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We have used different PKCζ mutant constructs or the PP2A inhibitor, okadaic acid (OKA), to selectively inhibit PKCζ- and PP2A-dependent pathways in cells expressing different caveolin-1 levels and evaluated the impact of insulin and ceramide on PKB/Akt activity in different PM subdomains. RESULTS Although the PKCζ-mediated negative effect of ceramide on insulin-stimulated PKB/Akt was dominant in adipocytes, a ceramide action through PP2A outside CEMs, prevented by OKA, was also unraveled. To test the importance of CEM to direct ceramide action through the PKCζ pathway, we treated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes devoid of CEMs with ceramide and we saw a shift of the lipid-negative action on PKB/Akt to a PP2A-mediated mechanism. In fibroblasts with low CEM abundance, the ceramide-activated PP2A pathway dominated, but could be shifted to a ceramide-activated PKCζ pathway after caveolin-1 overexpression. CONCLUSIONS Our results show that ceramide can switch from a PKCζ-dependent mechanism to a PP2A pathway, acting negatively on PKB/Akt, and hence revealing a critical role of CEMs of the PM in this process.","202272","Open Access","-0.1973","-0.5071","8","Human adipose tissue, Metabolism, Article","Human adipose tissue, Metabolism, Article",37,NA,NA,"",""

The objective was to determine whether SNAP23 may also be involved in the known association between lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle and insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes in humans, as well as to identify a potential regulator of SNAP23. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We analyzed skeletal muscle biopsies from patients with type 2 diabetes and healthy, insulin-sensitive control subjects for expression (mRNA and protein) and intracellular localization (subcellular fractionation and immunohistochemistry) of SNAP23, and for expression of proteins known to interact with SNARE proteins. Insulin resistance was determined by a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. Potential mechanisms for regulation of SNAP23 were also investigated in the skeletal muscle cell line L6. RESULTS We showed increased SNAP23 levels in skeletal muscle from patients with type 2 diabetes compared with that from lean control subjects. Moreover, SNAP23 was redistributed from the plasma membrane to the microsomal/cytosolic compartment in the patients with the type 2 diabetes. Expression of the SNARE-interacting protein Munc18c was higher in skeletal muscle from patients with type 2 diabetes. Studies in L6 cells showed that Munc18c promoted the expression of SNAP23. CONCLUSIONS We have translated our previous in vitro results into humans by showing that there is a change in the distribution of SNAP23 to the interior of the cell in skeletal muscle from patients with type 2 diabetes.

The goal of this study was to establish the relative contribution of endothelial cells and adipocytes, both highly expressing caveolin-1 to the lipoatrophic phenotype of mice with global caveolin-1 gene invalidation (Cav1-KO). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We compared adipose tissue development and metabolic phenotype of wild-type (WT), lipoatrophic Cav1-KO, and a murine model with specific rescue of caveolin-1 expression in endothelial cells (caveolin-1-reconstituted [Cav1-RC]). RESULTS Defective adipose tissue development, reduced adipocyte size, and global alteration in adipose tissue gene expression that characterize lipoatrophic caveolin-1 null mice were still observed in Cav1-RC, indicating a prominent role of adipocyte-derived caveolin in lipoatrophy. We also observed that Cav1-KO adipose tissue contained an increased proportion of infiltrated macrophages compared with control mice, mostly with an alternate activation M2 phenotype. In contrast with defective lipid storage and lipoatrophy, macrophage infiltration was normalized in Cav1-RC mice, pointing to caveolin-1-dependent endothelium permeability as the causing factor for adipose tissue macrophage infiltration in this model. CONCLUSIONS This is the first report of a specific role for adipocyte caveolin expression in lipid storage.

We examined whether the beneficial metabolic properties of lower-body AT are related to the production and release of the insulin-sensitizing lipokine palmitoleate (16:1n-7). Using venoarterial difference sampling, we investigated the relative release of 16:1n-7 from lower-body (gluteofemoral) and upper-body (abdominal subcutaneous) AT depots. Paired gluteofemoral and abdominal subcutaneous AT samples were analyzed for triglyceride fatty acid composition and mRNA expression. Finally, the triglyceride fatty acid composition of isolated human preadipocytes was determined. Relative release of 16:1n-7 was markedly higher from gluteofemoral AT compared with abdominal subcutaneous AT. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), the key enzyme involved in endogenous 16:1n-7 production, was more highly expressed in gluteofemoral AT and was associated with greater enrichment of 16:1n-7. Furthermore, isolated human preadipocytes from gluteofemoral AT displayed a higher content of SCD1-derived fatty acids. We demonstrate that human gluteofemoral AT plays a major role in determining systemic concentrations of the lipokine palmitoleate. Moreover, this appears to be an inherent feature of gluteofemoral AT. We propose that the beneficial metabolic properties of lower-body AT may be partly explained by the intrinsically greater production and release of palmitoleate.","unidentified","Open Access","-0.0483","-0.4764","8","Human adipose tissue, Metabolism, Article","Human adipose tissue, Metabolism, Article",41,"38","2","",""

Loss of caveolae produces lipodystrophic diabetes in humans, which cannot be reversed by endothelial rescue of caveolin expression in mice, indicating major importance of adipocyte caveolae. However, how caveolae participate in fat cell functions is poorly understood. We investigated dynamic conditions of lipid store fluctuations and demonstrate reciprocal regulation of caveolae density and fat cell lipid droplet storage. We identified caveolin-1 expression as a crucial step in adipose cell lines and in mice to raise the density of caveolae, to increase adipocyte ability to accommodate larger lipid droplets, and to promote cell expansion by increased glucose utilization. In human subjects enrolled in a trial of 8 weeks of overfeeding to promote fattening, adipocyte expansion response correlated with initial caveolin-1 expression. Conversely, lipid mobilization in cultured adipocytes to induce lipid droplet shrinkage led to biphasic response of cavin-1 with ultimate loss of expression of cavin-1 and -3 and EHD2 by protein degradation, coincident with caveolae disassembly. We have identified the key steps in cavin/caveolin interplay regulating adipocyte caveolae dynamics. Our data establish that caveolae participate in a unique cell response connected to lipid store fluctuation, suggesting lipid-induced mechanotension in adipocytes.","5P30DK072476-05","Open Access","0.3312","-0.0677","8","Human adipose tissue, Metabolism, Article","Human adipose tissue, Metabolism, Article",17,"41","1","",""

Optimally, the handling and access of ontologies should be completely transparent to the user. As a means to this end, we have developed a service that attempts to bridge the gap between experts in a certain knowledge domain, ontologists, and application developers. The ontology-based answers (OBA) service introduced here can be embedded into custom applications to grant access to the classes of ontologies and their relations as most important structural features as well as to information encoded in the relations between ontology classes. Thus computational biologists can benefit from ontologies without detailed knowledge about the respective ontology. The content of ontologies is mapped to a graph of connected objects which is compatible to the object-oriented programming style in Java. Semantic functions implement knowledge about the complex semantics of an ontology beyond the class hierarchy and \"partOf\" relations. By using these OBA functions an application can, for example, provide a semantic search function, or (in the examples outlined) map an anatomical structure to the organs it belongs to. The semantic functions relieve the application developer from the necessity of acquiring in-depth knowledge about the semantics and curation guidelines of the used ontologies by implementing the required knowledge. The architecture of the OBA service encapsulates the logic to process ontologies in order to achieve a separation from the application logic. A public server with the current plugins is available and can be used with the provided connector in a custom application in scenarios analogous to the presented use cases. The server and the client are freely available if a project requires the use of custom plugins or non-public ontologies. The OBA service and further documentation is available at http://www.bioinf.med.uni-goettingen.de/projects/oba.

The metabolome encompasses the entity of small molecules—Most often end products of a catalytic process regulated by genes and proteins—with the lipidome being its fat soluble subdivision. Within recent years, lipids are more and more regarded not only as energy storage compounds but also as interactive players in various cellular regulation cycles and thus attain rising interest in the bio-medical community. The field of lipidomics is, on one hand, fuelled by analytical technology advances, particularly mass spectrometry and chromatography, but on the other hand new biological questions also drive analytical technology developments. Compared to fairly standardized genomic or proteomic high-throughput protocols, the high degree of molecular heterogeneity adds a special analytical challenge to lipidomic analysis. In this review, we will take a closer look at various mass spectrometric platforms for lipidomic analysis. We will focus on the advantages and limitations of various experimental setups like ‘shotgun lipidomics’, liquid chromatography—Mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) based approaches. We will also examine available software packages for data analysis, which nowadays is in fact the rate limiting step for most ‘omics’ workflows.","202272","Open Access","0.0506","0.5404","9","Based lipidomics, Cardiovascular risk, Cholesterol levels","Based lipidomics, Cardiovascular risk, Cholesterol levels",57,"176","1","",""

A large structural heterogeneity results from differences in number, identity, linkage, and anomeric configuration of the carbohydrate residues, and also from structural differences within the hydrophobic part. GSLs form complex cell-type specific patterns, which change with the species, the cellular differentiation state, viral transformation, ontogenesis, and oncogenesis. Although GSL structures can be assigned to only a few series with a common carbohydrate core, their structural variety and the complex pattern are challenges for their elucidation and quantification by mass spectrometric techniques. We present a general overview of the application of lipidomics for GSL determination. This includes analytical procedures and instrumentation together with recent correlations of GSL molecular species with human diseases. Difficulties such as the structural complexity and the lack of standard substances for complex GSLs are discussed.","202272","Open Access","-0.1156","0.5707","11","Sphingolipid species, Chemistry, Human synovial fluid","Sphingolipid species, Chemistry, Human synovial fluid",17,NA,NA,"",""

The liver is highly metabolically active and one of its key functions is to control the balance of lipid throughout the body. A number of pathologies have been linked to the impact of HCV infection on liver metabolism. However, there is also growing evidence that hepatic metabolic processes contribute to the HCV life cycle. This review summarizes the relationship between lipid metabolism and key stages in the production of infectious HCV.

The high intake of game meat in populations with a subsistence-based diet may affect their blood lipids and health status. Objective. To examine the association between diet and circulating levels of blood lipid levels in a northern Swedish population.Study design. We compared a group with traditional lifestyle (TLS) based on reindeer herding (TLS group) with those from the same area with a non-traditional lifestyle (NTLS) typical of more industrialized regions of Sweden (NTLS group). The analysis was based on self-reported intake of animal source food (i.e. nongame meat, game meat, fish, dairy products and eggs) and the serum blood level of a number of lipids [total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), triglycerides (TG), glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids]. Results. The TLS group had higher cholesterol, LDL and HDL levels than the reference group. Of the TLS group, 65% had cholesterol levels above the threshold for increased risk of coronary heart disease (&gt;240 mg/dl), as compared to 38% of the NTLS group. Self-reported consumption of game meat was positively associated with TC and LDL.Conclusions. The high game meat consumption of the TLS group is associated with increased cholesterol levels. High intake of animal protein and fat and low fibre is known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, but other studies of the TLS in northern Sweden have shown comparable incidences of cardiovascular disease to the reference (NTLS) group from the same geographical area. This indicates that factors other than TC influence disease risk. One such possible factor is dietary phospholipids, which are also found in high amounts specifically in game meat and have been shown to inhibit cholesterol absorption.Keywords: epidemiology; nutrition; animal source foods; game; lipids; cholesterol; phospholipids; sphingolipids(Published: 5 August 2013)To access the supplementary material to this article, please see Supplementary files under Article Tools onlineThis paper is part of Supplement 1, 2013, ICCH15 Proceedings.

This process involves an orchestrated remodeling of lipids. The cleavage of precursor lipids from lamellar bodies by β-glucocerebrosidase, sphingomyelinase, phospholipases and sterol sulfatase generates ceramides, non-esterified fatty acids and cholesterol for the lipid-containing extracellular matrix, the lamellar membranes in the stratum corneum. The importance of triacylglycerol (TAG) hydrolysis for the formation of a functional permeability barrier was only recently appreciated. Mice with defects in TAG synthesis (acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2-knock-out) or TAG catabolism (comparative gene identification-58, -CGI-58-knock-out) develop severe permeability barrier defects and die soon after birth because of desiccation. In humans, mutations in the CGI-58 gene also cause (non-lethal) neutral lipid storage disease with ichthyosis. As a result of defective TAG synthesis or catabolism, humans and mice lack ω-(O)-acylceramides, which are essential lipid precursors for the formation of the corneocyte lipid envelope. This structure plays an important role in linking the lipid-enriched lamellar membranes to highly cross-linked corneocyte proteins. This review focuses on the current knowledge of biochemical mechanisms that are essential for epidermal neutral lipid metabolism and the formation of a functional skin permeability barrier.","202272","Open Access","0.264","0.137","13","Plasma membrane, Membrane lipids, Lipid droplets","Plasma membrane, Membrane lipids, Lipid droplets",16,NA,NA,"",""
